      "post_content": "<p><p>Forever dedicated to the craft, never losing sight of what he’s always set out to do, Caspa has remained resolutely underground in his sound and his motives. One of the only foundation artists to stay loyal to the genre’s roots, he’s flown the flag for dubstep’s most important ingredients; original soundsystem soul, deep, innovative production dynamics and the coming together of kindred spirits who really treasure and understand this music… Be they peers, new-gen producers or fellow music lovers who understand and appreciate why Caspa does what he does. If you’re still reading this, if you’re a diehard, a fighter and some who refuses to compromise, there’s a high chance that means you, too. Welcome to Ghost Town.</p></p>",
