He produces and performs different facets of house music by merging Afro and melodic elements with soulful and emotive influences. He is also well-versed with deeper, Afro melodic house under his Emvafaya alias. His flair, originality, and stage presence have gained him access to some of the most coveted stages in the US such as Nebula, Marquee, Webster Hall, Pacha, and Output, and in European cities such as Munich, Madrid, Zurich, Lisbon, Belgrade, Stockholm, and Paris where he frequently performs.  Francis has generated millions of streams under his catalog with past and upcoming releases on Deep Root, Spinnin', Armada, Subliminal, Insomniac, and BLOND:ISH's Abracadabra to name a few. His songs have reached the Top 10 on Beatport, been on some of Spotify’s most popular House &amp; Electronic playlists such as Housewerk, Happy Beats, and Chill Tracks, and his releases are also aired on some of the biggest dance music stations across the globe such as KISS FM, BBC Radio 1, Sirius XM, Radio 105, Radio FG, and NRJ France. Electronic music icons of the likes of Black Coffee, Adam Port, Themba, Diplo, Pete Tong, Carl Cox, Gorgon City, Claptone, and many others have supported his music – alongside world-renowned companies Disney, Porsche, IBM, Snapchat, Netflix, the UFC, and other brands that have licensed his music.</p></p>",
