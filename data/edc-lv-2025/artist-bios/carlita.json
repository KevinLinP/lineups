      "post_content": "<p><p>Carlita is a Turkish DJ and producer from Istanbul. A classical musician and multi-instrumentalist (drums, cello, bass and electric guitar), she experiments with a mix of live and electronic instruments in her productions, using different synths, sampled instruments, and field recordings from her travels. With early influences ranging from Turkish Psychedelia to Rock ‘n’ Roll, she combines an ever changing kaleidoscope of sounds and cultures into a driving electronic beat. Her signature eclectic, wordly sound and diverse musical background ensure her sets are always full of surprises, as she expertly crafts a musical journey with each performance.</p></p>",
