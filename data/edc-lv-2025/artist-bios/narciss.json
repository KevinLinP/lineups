      "post_content": "<p><p>Pain and pleasure, and the alchemy of converting one to the other through expression is more than a motif in Narciss’ music, it’s the theme.\r\n\r\n</p><p>At times it’s a lilting melody strung atop a shuffle of percussive activity, at others a thrumming reverie, heavy laden with low end and much more besides, but this variance of sounds inevitably resonates deep inside. Throughout their musical progression, Narciss has been indefatigable in their endeavors, which are motivated by the connection and catharsis that their music cultivates. This desire to share the transformative powers of music has not only imbued their output with an enticing and revelrous timbre, it has fostered collaborations with like-minded souls like Gerd Janson and DJ Boring, among others.\r\n\r\n</p><p>“There’s a red thread that I’ve been weaving through my life” says Narciss of their journey. As an artist, a queer person, a partner, and a human, the road they’ve walked has changed as it has changed them. The story unfolding thus far, in singles and EP’s as stanzas and chapters, tells of their trials and of their persistence in overcoming them. Styles evolved and sounds found and discarded alike, Narciss carries what they need and leaves to the past what’s in the past. The constant throughout their life and career, which is at the heart of their creative expression, is both a personal mantra and manifestation of their oeuvre - Per Aspera Ad Astra, “through hardships to the stars.”</p></p>",
