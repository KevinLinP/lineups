      "post_content": "<p><p>A charming fusion of extravagant glittery outfits, on-beat kickrolls, infectious energy and eternal devotion to her craft is the best way to describe the Australian-born DJ/producer Mish. Taking the leap to pursue her lifelong dream of leaving a mark on the Hardstyle scene, Michelle moved across the world to the Netherlands in 2017 and instantly got to work.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSince her debut release in 2020, Mish’s career has skyrocketed thanks to major knockout hits such as ‘Into The Night’ , ‘I GO HARD’ which recently reached 1 million streams and her leading collaborations with Sickmode ‘One And Only’, ‘RAVE LOVE’, 'TIME TO SHINE' and 'HATE OR LOVE IT'. Heavily inspired by many genres of music, Mish draws a lot of inspiration from older House music and always emphasises catchy vocals and her high-energy bangers!\r\n</p><p>\r\nMish’s popularity is also reflected in her ever-growing agenda and has resulted in her becoming one of the leading ladies in Hardstyle. She has played at events which includes bookings at major events such as Defqon.1, Decibel Outdoor, Dreamfields, Tomorrowland, Rebirth Festival, Intents Festival, Supremacy, Creamfields North, Midnight Mafia, Elektrum and many more. Her dynamic DJ sets are jam-packed with intensity, kickrolls and an eclectic selection of carefully-crafted tunes that maintain the ultimate vibe on the dancefloor.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith a laser focus on creating new music and expressing herself through DJ sets and Twitch streams, this adventure of a lifetime has only just begun for Mish.</p></p>",
