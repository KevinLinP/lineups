      "post_content": "<p><p>In a world where artists are often asked to pick their side and stick to it, Chris Avantgarde has proven a welcomingly stubborn exception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now based in London, his bold mantra has offered itself to the formation of AVANT/GARDE – a brand and identity garnering love and respect globally from both aspiring artists and industry influencers alike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A classically trained jazz pianist turned rule­breaking production prodigy, the German talent’s musical output speaks to taste buds across the electronic music spectrum, using consistent quality as its only predictable merit along the way. This versatile and unorthodox approach has made releases with both Dirtybird and Size Records an unprecedented possibility, garnering tastemaker support from such prestigious acts as Annie Mac, Claude VonStroke, Steve Angello and Galantis along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a sharp eye for new and outstanding talent and no shortage of personal contributions to the imprint, this is a brand that dares to evolve with the times whilst keeping the creative stamina ticking within the electronic dance space. Chris Avantgarde represents a breed of talent with the freedom to do what he wants within electronic music, giving the modern industry a fearless new frontrunner to keep tabs on for 2016.</p></p>",
