      "post_content": "<p><p>Laurens Elshof, aka Lavern, is a producer and DJ from the Netherlands. After a few years releasing music and touring as a DJ under the name Lyfes, Laurens started his musical journey as Lavern in 2021. He has developed a hybrid sound, inspired by EDM and House Music.\r\n</p><p>\r\nLiving in a small village surrounded by woods near Amsterdam, nature is Lavern's principal source of inspiration. This influence shaped his music in the way he combines dance and energetic night life vibes with more solar feelings. This is how his latest work took life, as he continues to explore his musical horizons.</p></p>",
