      "post_content": "<p><p>BIIA is a Portugal based artist. She plays stories told from techno and its slopes, sometimes markedly energetics, sometimes harsh and mental with abstract compositions. She conquer the dance floor with her eclectic music taste and her charismatic energy.\r\n\r\n</p><p>BIIA dived head-first into electronic music when she visited her cousin’s dj and production store at the age of 14, driven by an emotional curiosity that today is so mirrored in the creative process which she conducts her DJ sets and produces her first musics. It’s the way she discovered to pass feelings, to build relationships, to guide a dance floor through effusive and nostalgic moments, involving us in a spiral of affection that we don’t want to escape.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Her sets are influenced by London, Berlin and Detroit sounds. Stories told from techno and its slopes, sometimes markedly energetics, sometimes harsh and mental with abstract compositions, as if it were a roller coaster: dizzying climbs and falls, inversions and unexpected loops.\r\n\r\n</p><p>BIIA will continue to conquer and cement her electronic trail, transporting her eclectic approach to the dance floors.</p></p>",
