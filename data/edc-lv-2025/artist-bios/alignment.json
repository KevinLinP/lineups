      "post_content": "<p><p>One thing is certain, Italian wonder boy Alignment likes to turn heads.\r\n </p><p>\r\nWith a strong focus to work on his productions and DJ career, Francesco Pier has engaged himself in the heart of the vibrant techno scene. His tracks have caught the attention of techno heavyweights such as Richie Hawtin, Charlotte de Witte, Ben Klock, Chris Liebing, Laurent Garnier, Amelie Lens, Joseph Capriati, and many more…\r\n</p><p>\r\nPromoters across the EU followed to offer this young talent a spot on their best nights, quickly becoming a regular guest at KNTXT events, appearing on fabric’s compilation, and growing his fan base all over the globe rapidly.\r\n </p><p>\r\nDescribing his style as “A journey to the dark corners of one’s inner self” his music is reminiscent of an enigmatic soundtrack to an endless post-apocalyptic warehouse rave. Strong melodies are flanked by deep bass lines, pumping kicks, and reverberating synths. Don’t miss your chance to see him live on stage.\r\n</p></p>",
