      "post_content": "<p><p>VNSSA does not exist in the world of music because it is her choice, she exists in it because it is her calling.\r\n\r\n</p><p>VNSSA has always had a passion for music, even as a child. The Newport Beach native now calls Los Angeles home, and has immersed herself into the local electronic scene. Although Santa never gave her the turntables she wanted at a young age, she soon found herself drumming in local rock and indie rock bands. From there she started djing, and began performing at local clubs and house parties. After djing for 7 years and producing for 3, her debut single was released in early 2018 on House of Hustle Records and since, she has released multiple EP’s and singles on labels such as Dirtybird Records, Higher Ground, Dim Mak, Sweat It Out, Psycho Disco, Box of Cats, Strangelove Recordings, and many more, including a Beatport #1 single “Word”, with Walker &amp; Royce, on Black Book Records/ HotBoi. Her live sets cover all genres of house and techno, although don’t be surprised to hear some classic disco as well. VNSSA performs regularly at well-known venues all over the country and festivals including; Coachella, Dirtybird Campout, Lightning in a Bottle, EDC (Las Vegas, Orlando, and Mexico), Hard Summer, and more.</p></p>",

      "post_content": "<p><p>Hailing from the vibrant city of Miami, Nala got her start playing popular electronic clubs and festivals where she developed a reputation as an impeccable tastemaker. Her knowledge of house, indie dance, electro, and breaks, as well as her ability to add live vocals have made her a standout performer in the current field of house producers.\r\n\r\n</p><p>In 2020, her positive attitude and infectious DJ style caught the attention of Dirtybird Records' founder, Claude VonStroke, who mentored her for 3 years. Nala's unique take on Riot Grrrlstyle vocals and affinity for analog soundscapes helped garner the attention of the industry's top producers and allowed her to pave her own place within the community. Last year saw Nala play the nation's top clubs including Space Miami and marquee festivals including Coachella, Ultra, Electric Forest and Electric Zoo among many others.\r\n\r\n</p><p>In July 2022, Nala launched her own label, Mi Domina, a femme-dominant electronic label intent on merging punk rock aesthetics with underground dance music. The label's first release, Get Familiar EP, with fellow Dirtybird artist, E.R.N.E.S.T.O, was released the same day receiving accolades and support from Beatport and EDM.com to name a few.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Her 2022 releases on Dirtybird Records, Pets Recordings, and Black Book Records received worldwide support and charted several Beatport Top 100s and year-end lists. Her music video for \"The World is Always Ending\" with Nikki Nair was listed on Top 10 music videos of the year on Mixmag Asia.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Nala continues her meteoric rise in 2023 with festival and headline club plays across North America and an exciting schedule of original releases and remixes.</p></p>",
