The ga√∫cho who dominated the beatport charts also received constant support from prominent names in the scene such as: Michael Bibi, Jamie Jones, Marco Carola, Latmun, Mochakk, Classmatic and many others.\r\n\r\n</p><p>A clear love for music makes Beltran's productions full of personality and charisma, characteristics that are also expressed in his single 'Warning', released by Revival New York.\r\n\r\n</p><p>The solid groove expressed in his works is also highlighted in his DJ sets, which ensured Beltran's residency, on the grandiose label 'Basement' in Porto Alegre, RS - Brazil.\r\n\r\n</p><p>The project was also well received by the consecrated Amine Edge &amp; Dance, after signing two releases on CUFF, among them the single 'Basement' which features original vocals recorded by Beltran himself, expressing a message of presentation to the underground sound and also the track 'MFK', in collaboration with Cla$$ and JCult.</p></p>",
