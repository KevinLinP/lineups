Throughout 2020 the LA based artist is responsible for various visual productions that were utilized during lockdown streaming events, including features on Insomniac and Ivy lab's 20/20 global series which featured a collection of A/V works between audio and visual artist. Initially paired with UK artist Commodo, Lake produced an exceptional piece of work which left a lasting imprint on the 2020/ LDN label bosses. \r\n\r\n</p><p>Since then both artist have continued to work together on various projects including the most recent, Infinite Falling Ground; Ivy Lab's latest album released in 2022. Lake was tasked with developing all  the visual components for the album and tour. The phenomenal piece of work that came out the other end acts as an immersive tool used for their new live shows. \r\n\r\n</p><p>Joining them on tour, Lake debut his own live audiovisual performance showcasing a mixture of visual and audio abstractions. Lake Hills continues to diversify his own project by building a murky yet dreamy catalog which overall moves from Techno, Electronica and Experimental.
