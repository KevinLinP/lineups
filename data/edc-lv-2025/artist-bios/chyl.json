      "post_content": "<p><p>CHYL is a Los Angeles-based electronic dance music producer who is quickly making a name for herself in the industry. Despite graduating with a finance degree from Columbia University, she abandoned a promising career in investment banking to pursue her passion for dance music production. Since then, she has been on a meteoric rise, winning over fans with her infectious personality and energetic tracks.\r\n\r\n</p><p>As a pioneer in the genre of 150bpm Speed House, CHYL has garnered support from a range of industry tastemakers, including Steve Aoki, Habstrakt, Ghastly, Wuki, JSTJR and many more. Her high-energy productions, characterized by their fast pace and bass-heavy beats, have earned her a dedicated fanbase and a growing reputation as one-to-watch in the years to come.\r\n\r\n</p><p>2022 was a banner year for CHYL, marked by the international success of her viral remix of Kanye West's \"Mercy\" and her debut performance on the mainstage at Countdown festival. Her tracks have been featured on esteemed labels such as Monstercat, Bassrush, and Dim Mak, with the latter signing her in January 2023.\r\n\r\n</p><p>With her unique sound and relentless work ethic, CHYL is a force to be reckoned with and an inspiration to anyone who wants to pursue their dreams. Her journey from finance to dance music production is a testament to the power of following one's passions, and her success is a reflection of her dedication and hard work. She continues to blaze a trail in the industry, with no plans of slowing down anytime soon.</p></p>",
