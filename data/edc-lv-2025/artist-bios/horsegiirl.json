Although Stella is only a teenage foal she sings songs about heartbreak and the rural life that go right under your skin. The ability to translate her sensitivity into her lyrics are what unites human and horse: the deep emotions of existence. And while she pursues her dream of galloping over the world's biggest stages she never forgets her home at Sunshine Farms.</p></p>",
