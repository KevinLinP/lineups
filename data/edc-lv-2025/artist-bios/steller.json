      "post_content": "<p><p>Angelica Bafitis, professionally known as Producer/DJ “STELLER\", has rapidly gained a reputation as one of the most\r\nexciting up\r\n-\r\nand\r\n-\r\ncoming names in electronic music.\r\n</p><p>The South Florida based artist's long running passion for music stems early from her childhood but STELLER\r\ncontinued to pursue that passion for music throughout college, eventually receiving a Bachelor's Degree in Music with\r\na concentration in Music Techno\r\nlogy, and establishing herself as a proficient audio engineer and producer. After\r\ncollege, STELLER began exploring a transition into live performances by DJing at small clubs in Greece, where her\r\nfamily is from. Those performances ignited a fire which prom\r\npted her return to the US where she could further\r\ndevelop her career in a more bass/electronic focused market.\r\n</p><p>STELLER’s eclectic and unique sound has often been characterized as a mix of heavy/wonky bass, groovy vibes,\r\nand trap beats and is showcased thr\r\noughout her discography. In 2023, her Collaboration with Zingara\r\n-\r\n‘Find It In\r\nYour Mind’\r\n-\r\nsurpassed one million streams on Spotify and garnered support from major artists including Clozee and\r\nLSDream.\r\nNot stopping there, she unleashed her sophomore EP, ‘\r\nOpen Your Eyes,’ under the banner of Mersiv’s\r\nMorflo Records, and two scorching singles on Insomniac’s Bassrush Records and Boogie T’s Drama Cub Records.\r\nIt’s no surprise that STELLER’s funky and energetic bass sound has earned her the admiration and respe\r\nct of these\r\nheavyweight artists and labels.\r\n</p><p>STELLER has proven her skills go far beyond her production abilities with captivating support performances for\r\nworld\r\n-\r\nrenown DJs including Subtronics, Ganja White Night, and Peekaboo. Those performances catapulte\r\nd her into\r\nthe festival circuit, where the STELLER experience has enchanted audiences at iconic music festivals including Lost\r\nLands, Lollapalooza, Forbidden Kingdom, and Electric Daisy Carnival.\r\n</p><p>Fans will be fully immersed into STELLER's sonic universe\r\nthrough her upcoming release and tour schedule, so keep\r\nyour eyes, and most importantly minds open. You won't want to miss this!</p></p>",
