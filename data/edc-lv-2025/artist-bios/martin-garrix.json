      "post_content": "<p><p>Martin Garrix - the name that belongs to one of the youngest and most successful DJ’s/producers championing the pop and electronic scene. Garrix has taken his expertise across the globe, by headlining festivals, breaking through territories, and collaborating with major stars including Dua Lipa, Khalid and Bono, and The Edge. Climbing yet another rung of his ladder to stardom, he is a founder of his very own label (STMPD RCRDS), owner of a studio complex in Amsterdam, and a mentor to upcoming artists.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Now in his mid-twenties, multiple years into a career that began by debuting the single ‘Animals’ back in 2013. The invigorating, dance-floor stomper soared to the top of the charts worldwide, ultimately altering the status of what would be considered popular music. Continuing his voyage to conquer the mainstream catchment area over the years, Garrix has become responsible for providing us with infectious and anthemic dance and pop records alongside a string of memorable collaborations; ‘In The Name Of Love’ with Bebe Rexha, ‘Scared To Be Lonely’ with Dua Lipa, 'Ocean’ with Khalid, ‘Summer Days’ with Macklemore and Patrick Stump, and ‘We Are The People’ with Bono and The Edge.\r\n\r\n</p><p>There’s no doubt that this ability to reinvent his brand and fearlessly experiment with his sound is an undeniable testament to his talent and longevity, ultimately driving his legendary narrative even further.</p></p>",
