      "post_content": "<p><p>Hot Since 82 is a household name and luminary in the world of electronic music. His career as a DJ/producer has grown exponentially from playing 12 hour sets at the age of 17 in his hometown Barnsley, UK, to becoming a multi-million streaming artist.\r\n\r\n</p><p>In recent years, Hot Since 82 has released two very successful LPs: 8-track in 2019, followed by his first long awaited full-length studio album, Recovery, in 2020. ‘8- track’, a ‘deeply personal record’ created during a difficult year of Daley’s life, amassed over 30 million worldwide streams, with proceedings donated to mental health charity MIND. ‘Recovery’ was a ‘healing record’ featuring thirteen sonically diverse, bold tracks with a long list of culturally diverse collaborations including Boy George, Jamie Jones, Rudimental and Miss Kittin.\r\n\r\n</p><p>These are by no means his only achievements. A Mixmag and DJ Mag cover star, Daley has had numerous 'Essential New Tunes', 'Hottest Records in the World' and 'Essential Mixes' with BBC R and is a top 10 best-selling artist on Beatport. He has performed live at many of the world’s leading festivals such as Glastonbury and Coachella, held Ibiza residencies at Pacha, Space and Amnesia, has toured the world with his unique immersive clubbing experience TAKEN, has performed in Croatia in collaboration with Cercle from the Game Of Thrones King's Landing location, and has premiered his album from a hot air balloon flight… the list goes on.</p></p>",
