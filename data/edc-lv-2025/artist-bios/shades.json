      "post_content": "<p><p>Alix Perez (Belgium/UK) and Eprom (USA) are SHADES.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Perez found his rise to fame in drum n bass, releasing on Shogun Audio, Exit Recordings amongst many other labels and collaborating with the foremost names in dance and electronic music such as Noisia, Foreign Beggars, dBridge, and many more.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Eprom gained his well-deserved success through his innovative take on bass music, a unique sound that has the likes of Gaslamp Killer, Kutmah, D-Styles singing his praises and supporting his music.\r\n\r\n</p><p>SHADES exemplifies slanted grooves, a deep pocket and hard yet graceful composition. The debut self-titled EP (released on Alpha Pup) is a truly unique body of work.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Aware of each other's music for some time before meeting, Perez and Eprom first crossed paths at the 2013/2014 Northern Bass festival in New Zealand. The following summer they met again at the Red Bull Studios LA producing the Foreign Beggars’ Modus EP. This initial studio session led to further collaborations and SHADES was born.\r\n\r\n</p><p>XLR8R have rightly said “music that's not only a legitimate full-frontal assault in the same vein as tunes from that golden era of gluttonous bass and synths, but that embraces that ethos while giving it a more polished feel”.</p></p>",
