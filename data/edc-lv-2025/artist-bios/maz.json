By securing five chart-topping releases, including the Overall #1 with \"Amana”, he solidified his position as one of the leading Afro House artists in the world. He has performed in countries across Europe, Americas, Asia, Africa and Middle East.\r\n\r\n</p><p>What sets Maz apart from others is his innovative and distinctive approach to the genre. Skillfully blending Brazilian influences like samba percussions and Portuguese vocals, he creates a fresh and captivating experience for his audience. This unique fusion of influences has garnered him a dedicated fan base and critical praise.\r\n\r\n</p><p>In 2020, Maz founded Dawn Patrol, his own label, which later welcomed the talented Brazilian artist, Antdot, as a business partner. Together, they have produced several highly successful collaborations, notably \"Povoada\", which topped the afro house charts on Beatport.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Beyond his remarkable studio achievements, Maz boasts an impressive touring portfolio. He has been invited to perform at renowned venues and festivals such as Coachella, Tomorrowland Belgium, Tomorrowland Brasil, Ultra Europe, Circoloco Ibiza, Rock in Rio, Lollapalooza, Hï Ibiza, Laroc, GreenValley and Warung Beach Club, captivating audiences worldwide with his electrifying presence and talent.</p></p>",
