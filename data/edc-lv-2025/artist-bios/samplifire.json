      "post_content": "<p><p>In the ever changing bass music scene, France native Samy Beyou known as Samplifire has risen TO the forefront of modern dubstep. Inspired by legends such as Noisia, Rusko &amp; Skrillex, he started producing bass music in high school with a love for innovative sound design, potent basslines and fresh grooves. He rapidly gained recognition amongst the scene by releasing his first EP's on the iconic labels Never Say Die and Disciple plus his collaborations with Svdden Death, Barely Alive and Wooli to name a few.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSince hitting the dubstep scene, Samplifire has been touring all over the world including multiple headline tours in North America. Renownedly known as one of the top producers, 2023 was no different with his tracks, Menticide (w/ YAKZ) and Firestorm topping beatport charts, and being played out at almost every dubstep show you can go to. In 2024 Samplifire can be seen touring around the globe from plays in Europe to North America at festivals such as Rampage, Beyond Wonderland, and many more TBA. \r\n</p></p>",
