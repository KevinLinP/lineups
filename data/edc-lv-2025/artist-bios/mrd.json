Now another album is ready to go. MRD is clearly a hard working producer/DJ: with a bunch of hardcore releases in his rucksack, as well as a ferocious live set, 2019 looks set to be MRD's year. His sound is melodic, uncompromising, nostalgic, hard and honest, with a mix of new wave, hardcore, ambient, and banging dark techno.</p></p>",
