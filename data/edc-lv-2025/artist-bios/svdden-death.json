      "post_content": "<p><p>In a scene that is consistently changing, Bay Area native Danny Howland, better known as SVDDEN DEATH has taken a spot at the forefront in this new age of dubstep. Finding inspiration through legends within bass such as Noisia, 16BIT, and Skrillex, Danny has managed to formulate a hybrid of textured rhythms and sub-wrecking bass-lines that are of his own maniacal sound. </p><p>From releasing his first EP through the well-known Never Say Die: Black Label to now becoming one of the largest independent acts in dance music, his project continues to expand at unstoppable rates. Selling out world famous venues such as the Hollywood Palladium and Red Rocks Amphitheater.   </p><p>The dropping of his heavy hitting VOYD alter ego was a movement within itself. With the VOYD project came multiple highlighted moments in electronic music history, such as the first live play of the hit song “Behemoth” which has easily become a staple that is guaranteed to be repeated throughout the festival circuits, the moment he was lifted into the air at his SOLD OUT Hollywood Palladium being the first DJ to have to taken flight during a performance, as well as being the first DJ to play at the infamous Caverns in Tennessee. It is clear that SVDDEN DEATH has made his mark within the scene and will continue to level up while doing it.</p></p>",
