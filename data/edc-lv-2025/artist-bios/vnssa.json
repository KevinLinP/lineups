      "post_content": "<p><p>VNSSA does not exist in the world of music because it is her choice, she exists in it because it is her calling.\r\n\r\n</p><p>VNSSA has always had a passion for music, even as a child. The Newport Beach native now calls Los Angeles home, and has immersed herself into the local electronic scene. Although Santa never gave her the turntables she wanted at a young age, she soon found herself drumming in local rock and indie rock bands. From there she started djing, and began performing at local clubs and house parties. After djing for 7 years and producing for 3, her debut single was released in early 2018 on House of Hustle Records and since, she has released multiple EP’s and singles on labels such as Dirtybird Records, Higher Ground, Dim Mak, Sweat It Out, Psycho Disco, Box of Cats, Strangelove Recordings, and many more, including a Beatport #1 single “Word”, with Walker &amp; Royce, on Black Book Records/ HotBoi. Her live sets cover all genres of house and techno, although don’t be surprised to hear some classic disco as well. VNSSA performs regularly at well-known venues all over the country and festivals including; Coachella, Dirtybird Campout, Lightning in a Bottle, EDC (Las Vegas, Orlando, and Mexico), Hard Summer, and more.</p></p>",
