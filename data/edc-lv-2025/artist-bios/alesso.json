      "post_content": "<p><p>Multi-platinum DJ / producer Alesso is a global sensation who’s repeatedly proven that his\r\ninfluence transcends universal boundaries. A pivotal name in electronic music, Alesso has\r\namassed two RIAA-certified Platinum hits, two certified Gold singles, over 5.5 billion global\r\nstreams, and countless collaborations throughout the span of his iconic career. With a diehard\r\nfanbase that reaches across the world, Alesso continues to be a symbol of musical excellence\r\nin electronic music and beyond.\r\n</p><p>Born Alessandro Lindblad in Stockholm Sweden, Alesso quickly gained mainstream recognition\r\nfor his remixes of Tiësto, Swedish House Mafia, and Avicii before becoming a household name\r\nfor his own productions. Upon the release of just his second single, 2012’s “Calling (Losing My\r\nMind)” with Swedish House Mafia’s Sebastian Ingrosso and OneRepublic frontman Ryan\r\nTedder, he was certified 2X Platinum in Sweden while also reaching no. 1 on Billboard’s US Hot\r\nDance Club Songs. In 2014, he went Platinum in the U.S. with “Heroes (we could be)” featuring\r\nTove Lo. His 2014 album Forever, hit #1 on Billboard’s Top Dance/Electronic Albums and #30\r\non the Billboard 200. Since his debut, Alesso has proven that his music can seamlessly cross\r\nover into countless genres - to that end, he’s collaborated with such eclectic artists as Katy\r\nPerry, OneRepublic’s Ryan Tedder, Calvin Harris, Tove Lo, Liam Payne, James\r\nBay, Marshmello, Swedish House Mafia’s Sebastian Ingrosso, Hailee Steinfeld, Florida Georgia\r\nLine, Anitta, and more. On Billboard’s Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart, his massive breakup\r\nanthem “Let Me Go” — a collaboration with Hailee Steinfeld and Florida Georgia Line\r\n— reached No. 9, while “Is That For Me” peaked at No. 25.\r\n</p><p>In 2020, Alesso released a pair of hit singles: “Midnight” featuring Liam Payne and “THE END”\r\nwith goth-pop singer/songwriter Charlotte Lawrence. Soon after, he dropped his cosmic love\r\nballad “Chasing Stars (with Marshmello feat. James Bay),”the dynamic “Rescue Me (with Danna\r\nPaola)” from the Blade Runner Black Lotus soundtrack, and his winter floor-filler “Somebody To\r\nUse.”\r\n</p><p>To cap off 2021, Alesso made his NFT debut with the Cosmic Genesis collection and dropped\r\n“When I’m Gone” — his colossal collaboration with Katy Perry. This primed fans for his 2022\r\nreleases including “Words,” a smash crossover hit with Zara Larsson, which was hailed by\r\nBILLBOARD as the top dance song of 2022. It even spawned an EP of remixes featuring artists\r\nlike Chapter &amp; Verse, Sentinel, Arodes, and Majestic. Alesso followed that up with the Sentinel-\r\nassisted house anthem “Only You” and “Dark,” an atmospheric track created for THE\r\nBATMAN movie. He finished out the year with “We Go Out,” an ecstatic dance track created\r\nwith Sick Individuals. To date, Alesso has performed at international festivals ranging from\r\nTomorrowland to Ultra Music Festival to Electric Daisy Carnival, with his national TV experience\r\nincluding closing out GMA’s Summer Concert Series, performing on “The Late Show with\r\nJames Corden,” taking the stage at the AMAs and making his “Saturday Night Live” debut in\r\nJanuary 2022 with Katy Perry.\r\n</p><p>Over the last few years, Alesso has generated nearly 1B views on TikTok videos featuring his\r\nsongs and over 2M followers on Instagram. He’s landed 3 songs (“Let Me Go,” “Heroes,” and\r\n“When I’m Gone”) on the Billboard Hot 100, and now also has over 16M followers across\r\nvarious social media platforms. Alesso continually pushes the boundaries with his ever-evolving\r\nsound, proving that his impact will remain as timeless as his music for generations to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n125%\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p></p>",
