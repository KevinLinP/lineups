      "post_content": "<p><p>Hailing from Berlin and molded by German electronic music and culture, Nils Hoffmann has always found solace in music. As a classically trained pianist, Nils grew up listening to producers like Paul Kalkbrenner and Trentemoller, and was inspired to start producing melodic, deep, and progressive house. Now as one of the most exciting up-and-coming electronic artists in the world, Nils has his sights set on following in the footsteps of some of his favorite musicians and leading the charge as the next generation of electronic producers and live acts. To date the 26 year old producer has racked up over 75m streams across all platforms with tracks like \"Breathing\" with Ben Bohmer on Anjunadeep passing 25m streams. He's toured extensively across Europe, supporting acts like Ben Bohmer, Gorgon City, Franky Wah, Stephan Bodzin, Tiga and more. With the help of some of the top vocalists and songwriters in the world, Nils created his sophomore album 'A Radiant Sign.' Released through Anjunadeep, ’A Radiant Sign’ gathered over 5m streams in the first few months, received radio play on BBC and Sirius XM, DJ support from Maceo Plex and Above &amp; Beyond, and press coverage from NPR, and EDM.com among others.</p></p>",
