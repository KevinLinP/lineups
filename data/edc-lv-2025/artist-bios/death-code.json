      "post_content": "<p><p>Sergio Garcia, is returning to his hardcore roots under a brand new moniker: DEATH CODE. Born out of a love for his rock and metal influence, Garcia aims to take Hardstyle to the next level in the States with the DEATH CODE project, invigorating audiences with the energy and power Hard Dance never fails to deliver.\r\n\r\n</p><p>The North Hollywood-based producer has been making music for over a decade and has since played some of the biggest festivals in the world like Defqon.1 Australia, TomorrowWorld and Escape Halloween. He also released music under renowned labels such as Interscope, Dim Mak, and Q Dance under a different alias, and intends on achieving new heights with this new project.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Garcia previously made Hardstyle from 2014-2017 and decided to return to Hard Dance in late 2021, realizing his talent for genre-blending would be best served in his new endeavors as DEATH CODE. He hopes to give his day one fans a long-awaited surprise with his new music. With support from DJ Snake, Yellow Claw, Darren Styles, Angerfist and more, Death Code is sure to swiftly become a staple in the world of Hard Dance.</p></p>",
