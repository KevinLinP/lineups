      "post_content": "<p><p>David Rust a Scottish born Multi-Genre DJ and producer is a name on the rise. There is absolutely nothing rusty about David's skill set, in fact this slick DJ/Producer hailing from the city of Glasgow is without a shadow of a doubt one of the most promising new age artists.   A DJ first and foremost, His sound can be described as relentlessly technical. He is a true performer who fuses various upbeat styles on the more intense end of the edm spectrum.   A David Rust set is much more diverse than most, in that he takes Tech Trance, Hard Trance, Psy-Trance, Techno, Hardstyle old and new and bridges them seamlessly. Using a combination of chopping, cutting, scratching and with clever use of FX, a defined and expert performance is delivered. Keeping the mood dark and tech driven while introducing uplifting sounds to create a perfect blend of energising euphoria.</p></p>",
