Daya. A critical and commercial success, ‘Awake’ topped the iTunes Top Electronic Albums Chart in 12 countries with +100M streams.    In 2019, ILLENIUM released ‘Ascend,’ his third full-length album and his major label debut. As one of the biggest electronic releases of the year (+1B collective streams), the album topped Billboard's Top Dance/Electronic Albums chart and secured a Top 20 hit on the Billboard 200. The album includes the hit tracks \"Takeaway\" with The Chainsmokers ft. Lennon Stella, \"Good Things Fall Apart\" with Jon Bellion, \"Crashing\" ft. Bahari, \"In Your Arms\" with X Ambassadors and “Take You Down,” which chronicles his past battles with drug addiction.    Recognized as one of Billboard’s Top Dance/Electronic Artists of the 2010s, ILLENIUM brings his dynamic music to life via his live show, which has dominated festivals like Coachella, Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo and EDC. His 2019 Ascend Tour, which featured a five-piece live band, sold out landmark venues like Madison Square Garden (NYC), STAPLES Center (L.A.) and three consecutive nights at Red Rocks Amphitheatre (Denver).</p></p>",
