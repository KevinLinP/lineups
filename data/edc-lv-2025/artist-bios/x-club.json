      "post_content": "<p><p>The sound of X CLUB., the dance production duo of Ben Clarke and Jesse Morath, is not easily defined. Inspired by early 90s techno all the way through to future-facing drum’n’bass, X CLUB. has carved out a space entirely their own thanks to their authentic and eclectic take on dance music with serious consideration for underlying groove. Currently based in London, X CLUB. counts the likes of Steel City Dance Discs, Lobster Theremin and StayOnSight as homes for their releases already. Their sets are at once precise and considered as they are unrelenting and propulsive. The pair opt to guide their audience on a dynamic, energetic and unpredictable ride, upping the intensity and chaos before reaching total dancefloor liberation. X CLUB. has hit the ground running in 2022 and is leaving no stone unturned with an extensive EU/UK tour after multiple sold out shows and tours at home as well as a festival-defining set at Pitch Music &amp; Arts. The year’s second half in Europe sees bigger shows in new cities with Paris, London and Berlin all coming into the picture for major plays. The duo will be rounding out the year back in Australia at Beyond The Valley, Lost Paradise, and what is expected to be an unforgettable NYE with a very special international guest. X CLUB. remain a serious force du jour and one which will be felt across the world as they continue their mission of global domination — one dancefloor at a time.</p></p>",
