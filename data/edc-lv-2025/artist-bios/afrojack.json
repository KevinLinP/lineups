      "post_content": "<p><p>As one of the most innovative and sought-after artists, Grammy Award-winning producer and DJ Afrojack, continues to shatter boundaries and push music in bold new directions. Since making his breakthrough with the multi-platinum-selling single ‘Take Over Control’. In the last few years, Afrojack was named one of the 50 Most Important People in EDM by Rolling Stone, placed on the Forbes ‘30 Under 30’ music list, became the second DJ ever to cement his hands into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and performed during the interval act of the Grand Final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2021. He was able to create a show that isn’t easy to match. Together with Dutch top talents Glennis Grace and Wulf, and accompanied by a classical youth orchestra, Afrojack is the first DJ in the history of the Eurovision Song Contest who performs during the interval act in the Grand Final. Over 200 million households in 41 countries saw Afrojack performing on the iconic Erasmusbrug in Rotterdam, and taking this into the venue for an epic ending of his performance.\r\n\r\n</p><p>In 2021 Afrojack added the world wide hit ‘HERO’ to his already impressive repertoire, a collaboration with David Guetta. The song, co-written by Ellie Goulding, Stargate, Ryan Tedder and Jamie Scott, became another number 1 hit on the US dance radio chart which has reached 50 million streams to date. Recently, ‘HERO’ got nominated for a Grammy Award 2022 in the category Best Dance/Electronic Recording.</p></p>",
