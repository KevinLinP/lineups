      "post_content": "<p><p>Growing up in small-town New Zealand, electronic producer Jack Laven, aka 33 Below, started playing around with music software, as a new creative outlet. Fast forward a couple of years and 33 Below is quickly becoming a familiar name in the vocabulary of electronic music fans around the world. From DnB to emotional UKG, 33 Below has been pushing the envelope and developing his sound over the past couple of years, which has been presented in the form of his debut EP ‘Motions’. The project was released on Th3rd Brain Records, accompanied by a plethora of visual content. The project featured singles including the liquid DnB ‘Keep You As A Memory’, hooky UKG ‘Next to Me’ and emotional garage track ‘Cycles’. 2023 see's 33 Below evolving his sound and pushing his mixed-genre sound to the front. His first release of 2023 was his garage remix of Odd Mob’s club hit ‘LEFT TO RIGHT’, which has already caught the attention of Disclosure, What So Not, DJ EZ, and AC Slater. This was quickly followed by a collaboration with San Francisco based producer demotapes on the lush 'sedatives', as well as an official remix of SILK's breakout single 'Quiver'. 33 has been expanding his audience through unique and hard hitting live shows including playing festivals, supporting Fred Again.. on his only NZ show, and selling out headline shows.</p></p>",
