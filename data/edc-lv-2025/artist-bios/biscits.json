      "post_content": "<p><p>Hailing from Southampton, UK, BISCITS has had a seminal impact on the global dance scene. Likened to some of the genre’s leading names, including Dom Dolla, Sidepiece and Noizu, BISCITS’ reputation for full-bodied peak-time cuts has seen him attain an impressive global appeal in a relatively short space of time.</p><p>Standout releases on some of the industry’s most respected imprints, including SOLOTOKO, Higher Ground, Black Book and Sola, have cemented BISCITS’ acclaim as a sought-after producer.</p><p>BISCITS prides himself on regular support from Pete Tong &amp; Danny Howard on BBC Radio 1, Sirius XM, Slam Radio, Radio FG and many more. It’s fair to say that the BISCITS sound remains entrenched at the precipice of modern dance music.</p><p>An undeniably talented remixer, BISCITS has also reimagined the work of several high-profile artists, including Ed Sheeran, Moby and Becky Hill, amongst others. His debut album also saw him collaborate with several artists, including Karen Harding, Good Boys, Everyone You Know, Sonny Fodera and more.</p><p>Outside of the studio, his performance passport is littered with stamps from North America, South America, the UK, Europe and Australia performing alongside Gorgon City, Fisher, Chris Lake, Cloonee, Sidepiece and WADE across the likes of Reading &amp; Leeds Festival, EDC, Tomorrowland and support across Sonny Fodera’s US Tour in 2022.</p><p>BISCITS continues to be one of the industry’s most promising and fastest-growing talents, with much left to give.</p></p>",
