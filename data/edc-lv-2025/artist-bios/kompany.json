      "post_content": "<p><p>In a scene divided between rail riders waiting for the heaviest drop and stage hoppers seeking out the most technical sounds, Los Angeles bass DJ/producer Kyle Hagberg (aka Kompany) rises above with one foot firmly planted on each side. A former sound designer for Cymatics, Hagberg delivers meticulously crafted basses packaged as festival music, creating a distinct dubstep style many have tried to emulate over the years.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Kompany has collaborated with bass music giants such as Excision, SLANDER, Subtronics and Sullivan King, and was once name dropped by ILLENIUM as one of his favorite heavy artists. Some of Kompany’s most recognized tracks are his anthemic collaborations with fellow briddim godfather Wooli, notably 2018’s “Thicc Boi.”\r\n\r\n</p><p>His 2021 Untouchable Tour marked Kompany’s first run of headline shows, with him performing at over 30 clubs and festivals across the United States and Canada, including a coveted main stage slot at Lost Lands. In 2022 he did a worldwide festival run and joined a handful of higher ticket tour packages to warm up to headline bigger rooms in 2023.</p></p>",
