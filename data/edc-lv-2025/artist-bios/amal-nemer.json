According to her, music is the most powerful and universal tool to connect minds, bodies, and souls. Since she was a child, she had the gift of always feeling very connected to music in all its versions. For her, this is a place of peace and union, long before deciding to make a career out of it.\r\n</p><p>Today, she is a talented DJ and music producer that makes her way through the industry by leaps and bounds. Amal Nemer, of Lebanese heritage, was born in 1995 in Barinas, Venezuela. She moved to Miami in 2020, at the same time she decided to start her path in the music industry as a DJ and producer. </p><p>\r\nToday, with tracks available on all platforms, she is signed by labels such as Moon Harbour, Glasgow Underground, Nervous Records, among many others.\r\n</p><p>In the DJ booth, Amal leans towards genres like Tech House, Afro House, and Melodic House; combined with her charismatic personality and her energetic way of connecting with the public, and is capable of making anyone dance. </p></p>",
