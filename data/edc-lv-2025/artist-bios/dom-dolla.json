      "post_content": "<p><p>Australia’s DOM DOLLA is experiencing a meteoric rise, his signature style of house music is connecting with global audiences, recognised as one of the most exciting producers in electronic music.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Born in Manila, raised in outback Northern Australia, Dom discovered dance music when his Mother handed him a copy of Basement Jaxx’ 2001 album ‘Rooty\" while on holiday in Denpasar. Dom made the move to Melbourne, teaming up with high school mates hosting pub-discos &amp; djing on weekends whilst working as a graphic-designer during the week. In 2015 Dom was encouraged to quit his day job to pursue his obsession with music and production.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Dom’s break out year following the release of ‘Take It’, Dom quickly followed up delivering a royal flush of releases including ‘San Frandisco’ ‘Moving Blind’, ‘Pump The Brakes’ and ‘Strangers’ w/ Mansionair. In 2022, Dom returned with the highly anticipated single ‘Miracle Maker’ featuring Clementine Douglas.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Dolla’s catalog continues to accumulate over half-a-BILLION streams, with 2x Platinum &amp; 2x Gold Certified Singles, receiving the ultimate Australian recognition of winning an ARIA award for ‘Best Dance Release’, and has been commissioned by the biggest names in music to deliver official remixes for RÜFÜS DU SOL, Dua Lipa, Calvin Harris, The Martinez Brothers &amp; Louie Vega ft Marc E. Bassy, and Gorillaz ft. Tame Impala. The latter reached #1 on Beatport's Top 100 Charts for six consecutive weeks.</p></p>",
