      "post_content": "<p><p>Brutalismus 3000 is a Berlin-based duo that combines elements of early Gabber and Hardstyle, as well as Punk and Wave music, to create a fresh and contemporary sound. Theo Zeitner lays the groundwork while Victoria Vassiliki Daldas adds her distinct voice and writes lyrics in Slovak, English, and German. This multilingual expression adds diversity and openness to the duo's performance, highlighting the different rhythms of the languages.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Their performances are expressive and unconventional, featuring fast-paced, rough kicks, unique synths, and classic 909 sounds. They perform around the globe, leaving a lasting impression with their outstanding tracks and unique live sets, making an impact with their performances at Berlin's prestigious Berghain, California's Coachella or their iconic Boiler Room. As they have exciting shows, playing the world's biggest festivals they aim to expand their project to a wider audience while maintaining the originality and edge of their sound, which will be heard across the globe.</p></p>",
