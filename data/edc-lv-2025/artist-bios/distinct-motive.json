He quickly made a name for himself with his dark and minimal production style. Paying homage to the early aesthetic of dubstep while building a sound unique unto himself, he has put his respective hometown of Toronto on the map in international bass music circles, advocating for the original, dub-influenced side of dubstep to elated audiences across North America and Europe.</p></p>",
