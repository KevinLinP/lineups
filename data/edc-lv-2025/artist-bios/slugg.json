With 90's hip hop as a major influence in his music, Slugg's style is a masterful fusion of different elements, with each track he produces boasting a distinct flavor that sets it apart from the rest. He has a way of pulling you in and keeping you engaged with the dynamic range of sounds, making him a favorite among fans and fellow DJs alike. \r\n\r\n</p><p>After moving from Miami to Orlando, he found his way into the music scene through a collective called House Keepers, where he started releasing music and playing their events. This experience motivated him to strive for even greater heights in his music career, leading him to start his own imprint called Getbusy.\r\n \r\n</p><p>Slugg's impressive talent and hard work have earned him the opportunity to play at major festivals like BPM, EDC Orlando, Skyline Music Festival, iii points, and Okeechobee Music Festival. His music has been supported by some of the biggest names in the industry, including Loco Dice, Jamie Jones, Joseph Capriati, Fisher, Mason Collective, Ben Sterling, and Classmatic, among others.
