      "post_content": "<p><p>Liverpool has always been known for its rich musical heritage, but in recent years, it's house music that's been ringing through the streets of this northern city. With house music royalty such as CamelPhat &amp; Yousef flying the flag for so long, all eyes now fall on SOSA as Liverpool's new rising star.\r\n</p><p>\r\nRecognised for his hypnotic grooves, SOSA has been busy honing his skills in the studio, perfecting his signature minimal-tech productions. His tracks have picked up support from key tastemakers such as The Martinez Brothers, Michael Bibi, PAWSA, and Jamie Jones, with releases on Cutting Headz, Hottrax, COCO, Solid Grooves RAW, Black Book Records, Moxy Music, Repopulate Mars, Sola, Ultra, Hot Creations, and Ministry of Sound, to name a few.\r\n</p><p>\r\n2022 has been a year of key moments for SOSA, starting with his remix of Chris Lake &amp; NPC's track 'A Drug From God', followed by debuts with Catch &amp; Release, 'Slow Down', and Hot Creations with his collab EP with Prok | Fitch. He also returned to his highly successful COCO imprint with 'No Bueno' &amp; 'NOVELA' before capping off the year with a massive remix of one of the biggest house records of the year in the form of Chris Lorenzo &amp; Cobrah's 'Mami' record. With many highly anticipated releases slated for 2023 already, it's no surprise that SOSA is widely touted as the hottest producer in the minimal tech scene.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOutside of the studio, SOSA maintains a stacked tour diary with a plethora of performances at the biggest and best venues and festivals across the globe. His sets at premier UK venues like Blackstone Street Warehouse, Warehouse Project &amp; Printworks have propelled him in the UK as one of the hottest tickets in house music. Never more evident than at his standout Creamfields set this summer at the all-new Runway stage. Outside of the UK, SOSA has been enjoying a successful 2022 season in Ibiza and has also become a fan's favorite across the Netherlands and Italy. SOSA toured the USA for the first time in 2022, with his 9-date Dance Lapse tour taking center stage. The young Liverpudlian also returned with another COCO show in his hometown, selling out Invisible Wind Factory and joined by wAFF and Lyndsey Matthews.</p></p>",
