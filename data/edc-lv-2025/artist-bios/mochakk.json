      "post_content": "<p><p>Rising up out of Brazilâ€™s hotbed of formidable talent, Mochakk (AKA Pedro Maia) embodies a level of passion and drive that has placed him in a league of his own. His insatiable hunger for knowledge means he has a broad palette to draw from, channelling his deep well of influences into his vibrant creative output. As anyone who has witnessed him in action will attest, Pedro wears his heart on his sleeve, often expressing his honest love for music in an endearingly physical manner. His skills as a selector have led to bookings at globally renowned clubs, like DC-10, while his productions encapsulate his diverse sonic identity. Commanding the global stage with vigour, humour and his illuminating personality, Mochakk is laying down the foundations for an enduring legacy.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Growing up in the midst of skating and hip-hop culture, he found his musical start as a beatmaker before eventually pivoting to electronic music. After discovering house music, he became a dedicated student of the genre and used that to his advantage as he progressively made waves in his home country of Brazil, both as a meticulous producer and mesmerizing performer. In recent months he headlined his own Cercle Music show, their largest capacity to date with 4,500 tickets selling out in just under 3 hours, along with memorable shows at Coachella, Printworks, Sonar and more. Upcoming sees Mochakks residency in Circoloco Ibiza and Vegas.</p></p>",
