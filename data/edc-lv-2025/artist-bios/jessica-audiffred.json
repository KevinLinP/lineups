      "post_content": "<p><p>Jessica Audiffred, Mexico City's \"Queen of Bass,\" is a global force in electronic music. With collaborations alongside Excision, DJ Diesel, and Flux Pavilion, she has headlined multiple 50-city North American tours, founded her label A Records, and created Mexico’s first bass-centric event, “Mad House,” which has sold out multiple years in a row, drawing over 5,000 fans each time. Known for electrifying performances at iconic festivals like Tomorrowland, Electric Daisy Carnival, Ultra Music Festival, and Lollapalooza, she continues to push boundaries. From sold-out shows at the Hollywood Palladium to her highly anticipated debut album, Jessica is primed to redefine bass music in 2025.</p></p>",
