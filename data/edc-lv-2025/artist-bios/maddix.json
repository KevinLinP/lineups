Drawing on the percussive roots of his childhood, with releases alongside Spinnin’, Armada, Rave Culture, and Hardwell’s Revealed Recordings, Maddix continues to be in the spotlight on streaming platforms and dance floors alike.\r\n\r\n</p><p>The immense growth of his own established sound is creating tremors in the global electronic dance music scene getting the full support of all big names, varying from Techno artists like Amelie Lens, HI-LO / Oliver Heldens and UMEK to EDM and Trance artists like Hardwell, Dimitri Vegas &amp; Like Mike, Tiesto and Armin van Buuren.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Finding a renewed partnership with Revealed Recordings, his music went viral on Instagram and TikTok and received numerous #1 genre spots on the most important DJ download portal Beatport. In combination with achieving around 4 million monthly listeners on Spotify, one can say Maddix has created a movement that will change the world.\r\n\r\n</p><p>His audience has grown into a truly global collective with appearances at such marker festivals as Ultra Music Festival, Parookaville, World Club Dome, and Mysteryland.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Maddix’ sound and brand continue to blaze the trail and up the ante for electronic music.</p></p>",
