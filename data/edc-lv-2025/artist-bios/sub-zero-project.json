      "post_content": "<p><p>Hardstyle duo Sub Zero Project aka Nigel Coppen and Thomas Velderman have taken the hard dance scene by storm. As teenagers they started their careers in 2014. The combination of high quality productions and a unique signature sound, launched this Dutch duo to the top in no time. Sub Zero Project is best known for their hits within Hardstyle, such as; ‘Darkest Hour’, ‘Our Church’, ‘Halo’ and ‘Trip To Mars’. All of these bangers have reached tens of millions of streams. Thanks to their success, Sub Zero Project have been able to spread their sound on a global scale by performing on the biggest dance stages in the scene – Tomorrowland, Electric Daisy Carnaval, Defqon.1 Weekend Festival, Ultra Music Festival, Medusa Festival, and Qlimax to name a few.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Throughout their career, Sub Zero Project have worked with several big artists such as; Timmy Trumpet, W&amp;W, Hardwell, Vini Vici, Da Tweekaz, Headhunterz and many more. This is only at the beginning of so much more to come. After releasing their second album, a piece of art called ‘Renaissance Of Rave’ in 2022, they've set the bar for 2023. Fueled with brand new bangers and the craziest live show experience ‘Psychodelic’. Sub Zero Project is your must see act during one of their 100+ shows this year!</p></p>",
