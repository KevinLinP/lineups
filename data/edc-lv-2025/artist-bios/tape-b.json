      "post_content": "<p><p>Berk Alkanat, AKA Tape B, is a bass music producer that has a wide range of styles but is known for his unique and nostalgic approach to how he does things. With plenty of original heavy hitters, Tape B has been drawing a lot of attention through his classic OG dubstep and hip-hop remixes. Already showcasing a keen attention to detail and a fantastic array of genre-bending experimentations, he has steadily climbed the proverbial ladder of “artists you need to start paying attention to immediately.” He has caught the eye of forward-thinking platforms like Deadbeats, UKF, Subsidia, Wakaan, and Wubaholics, and has been supported by artists such as Zeds Dead, Excision, Peekaboo, Liquid Stranger, Of The Trees, Wooli and countless others.\r\n</p></p>",
