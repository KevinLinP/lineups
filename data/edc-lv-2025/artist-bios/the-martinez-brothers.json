      "post_content": "<p><p>The Martinez Brothers are two of the most consistent and recognizable names in the world of house / techno.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>Introduced to disco and house music by their father from a young age, they come from the roots of New York's legacy club, The Paradise Garage. \r\n\r\n</p><p>While known for producing lean and effective club records including their break out \"H2 Da Izzo\" in 2012 to their 2019 Lil Yachty Feat. Lil Baby \"SaintLaurentYSL\" remix, their 2020 foray into Latin pop with Rauw Alejandro, Zion &amp; Lennox, Mr. Naisgai \"Química\" and in 2021 The Martinez Brothers Feat. Fuego “Pendiente Al Paso” shows their capacity to navigate effortlessly between underground and pop.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>Famous for their extended DJ marathon sets at Club Space in Miami and in Ibiza, they have performed around the world regularly selling out some of the largest venues and hosting stages at the biggest international music festivals. \r\n\r\n</p><p>The summer of 2022 sees them launching a new weekly residency at Hï Ibiza, which was named 'best club in the world' by the International Nightlife Association in 2018 and 2019.   \r\n\r\n</p><p>Despite a hectic international tour schedule, The Martinez Bros have stayed true to the NYC culture that raised them. \r\n\r\n</p><p>Authenticity is everything; it’s clear why these two are the leaders within dance music's new guard.</p></p>",
