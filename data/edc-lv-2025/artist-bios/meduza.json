      "post_content": "<p><p>In the space of two years Meduza became the biggest global streaming Italian artist in the history of music in Italy. Their debut release, Piece Of Your Heart featuring  Goodboys, has now seen over 2 billion streams globally, reaching the top 10 of the official charts in 20 countries and was a 2019 GRAMMY nomination in the best dance recording category. The follow up single, Lose Control with Goodboys and Becky Hill, made an unprecedented impact, reaching the UK Top40 in its first week, also notching upward of 2 billion cumulative streams. These headline successes are also bolstered by an impressive catalogue of hand picked remixes for the likes of MK, Ed Sheeran and Faithless, displaying Meduza’s ability to create a stand out club release whenever called upon. MEDUZA's 3rd single Paradise featuring Dermot Kennedy continued the trend with gold and platinum certifications in 24 countries with over a billion streams across all platforms. Tell It To My Heart feat Hozier rounded off 2021, reaching the UK charts as well as global accclaim. Their brand new single Bad Memories (feat. Elley Duhé &amp; FAST BOY) is charging up the charts globally and looks set to continue the meteoric rise of the Italian trio. The touring diary for MEDUZA continues to display its insatiable demand for the hottest act in electronic music from performing at the likes of Elrow, Warehouse Project (Manchester), Green Valley Brazil and EDC. Meduza continue to be the benchmark for dance music, globally.</p></p>",
