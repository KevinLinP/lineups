With her unique music style combining deep progressive sounds and dark energetic beats Laura is bound to make major waves in her career.\r\n\r\n</p><p>It all started when a young girl Laura fell in love with electronic music at the age of only 12. Her music career started by winning a famous DJ contest at the Blue Marlin on Ibiza at the age of just 17 years old. After this Laura got inspired to take her career in music serious and she graduated in “Electronic Music Production” and studied “Audio Engineering” at the SAE Institute in Amsterdam. This has helped her develop professionally and allowed her to bring her music and shows to the next level. This paved the way for Laura her first releases on influencing labels in progressive house, like DOORN Records, Protocol Records and Smash Deep.

Which opened the doors for Laura to make her first entrance with ‘Set Me Free’ on the ‘Anjunabeats Rising EP’ by the renowned London based dance record label by Above &amp; Beyond. Immediately following up with her single releases ‘This Love’ and ‘Take Me Away’, all topping the trance &amp; progressive charts, while getting the opportunity to mix the Anjunabeats Rising Residency Mixes. Simultaneously Laura got picked up on Armin van Buuren his radar, siging her track ‘The Journey’, ‘Needing You’ and ‘True Colors’ with Chris Howard to his personal Armind imprint. Leading up to Laura being a frequent main support dj for both Armin van Buuren and Above &amp; Beyond across the globe, including shows at Printworks in London together with Above &amp; Beyond, and Wondersala Riga, Ushuaïa Ibiza and her first full tour throughout India together with Armin van Buuren.
