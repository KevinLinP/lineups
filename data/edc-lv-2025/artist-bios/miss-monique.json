      "post_content": "<p><p>Miss Monique is today among world’s fastest rising Progressive House DJs, and probably the most recognised female DJ in this genre in Europe.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Unlike most other popular DJs nowadays, who made their name producing rather than mixing, she rose to fame bringing the old school back with her unprecedented conversion of classic radio mixes into the form of YouTube podcasts.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Miss Monique’s unique talent of smoothly melting techno rhythms with classic trance and progressive tunes year after year gets highly appraised by an ever-growing number of electronic music aficionados. By 2020, her live sets gather thousands of progressive house addicts online, with recorded streams gaining up to 2 million views. Miss Monique’s most popular set on Radio Intense channel boasts a whopping 11+ million views.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Her performances have been admired in more than 40 countries across the globe and counting — from small-scale cosy boat parties in Ibiza to renowned first-rate global festivals such as Untold or ADE.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Miss Monique started her own label — Siona Records, in 2019, to support the growth of aspiring progressive artists. In June, the label made it to Top 10 best selling progressive house labels on Beatport.</p></p>",
