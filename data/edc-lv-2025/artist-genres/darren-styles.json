  "cleanBio": "Darren Styles is a DJ & producer that’s never far from the forefront of the harder styles of electronic dance music worldwide. His productions have gone from strength to strength over the years as his studio work, both solo and collaborations, continues to take the charts by storm. His partnership with Norwegian hardstyle act Da Tweekaz created some of hard dance’s biggest tracks & in 2018 together they launched the record label ‘Electric Fox’. Darren’s work with duo W&W on the track Long Way Down catapulted him to a whole new audience. His track Switch is arguably one of the most versatile tracks of recent years, featuring in every big name DJ. In the past Darren found solo success with the release of his debut album SkyDivin’, which entered the official UK Album chart at number 4 and sold over a quarter of a million copies. Darren was also the first UK Hardcore artist to play world-renowned festival EDC Las Vegas back in 2013, and has been a staple on the BassCon stage every year since. More recently Darren has achieved some of the most significant moments of his career as he ticked off debut sets at Europe’s biggest festivals including Tomorrowland, Parookaville, Defqon 1 and Creamfields. Sell out headline shows are par for the course at venues such as The Exchange in LA to the Enmore in Sydney to Fuze in Kuala Lumpur. Whether it’s an intimate club or huge festival, the energy that Darren brings with his music is addictive.",
