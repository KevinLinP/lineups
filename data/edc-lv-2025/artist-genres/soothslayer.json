  "name": "Soothslayer",
  "cleanBio": "Having spent the better part of the past decade chasing basslines in dank warehouses all across the United States, the Southern-bred drum & bass artist known as Soothslayer has finally come into her own with her own addictive take on the genre. Known to her friends as Caroline Miller, this die hard junglista originally found her way to the 174 bpm mark via downtempo and trip hop, with well received compositions and productions that fueled a love for epic atmospheres and wall-trembling basslines.\n\nHaving relocated in 2008 from North Carolina to Los Angeles, Soothslayer quickly became a name to be reckoned with as the West Coast scene welcomed her with open arms and she fell in with a like-minded crew of bass lovers. She had her first drum and bass release on Insomniac Records in 2017 and since has released on Bassrush Records and Viper Records. Having represented for some of SoCal's finest, Soothslayer has flexed her skills on the decks for Respect Drum and Bass, Big Booty Bass, Camp Trip, and is a part of Insomniac's own Bassrush crew. She had her first festival debut in 2016 at Nocturnal Wonderland and since has played the Bassrush stage at Beyond Wonderland, EDC Las Vegas, EDC China, Countdown NYE, Project Z and more. Dropping jaws and working the crowd into a frenzy, there's no doubting that Soothslayer has found her calling and is here to slay!",
