  "name": "Masha Mar",
  "cleanBio": "Serbian-born and LA-based, Masha Mar generates with potency from each corner of her creative triangle. As a DJ, she spans the breadth of ability, gliding from festival stages to the undulating club floor - each with an electric grip on the corresponding crowd. She compliments this punchy output with a steadfast devotion to independent radio, upholding her residencies on both NTS & Dublab.\n\nShe released her debut EP Virgil's Dream in November 2022 on Night Prism, following searing singles with SOS Music, Femme House, and Dusk Recordings. Her next EP, also with SOS Records, is due in the first quarter of 2024 and unveils an evolving sound that has an immediate ring of raging dance floor authenticity.\n\nThe final aspect of Mashaâ€™s trifecta is expressed in her event production and creation. Co-founding event series Dig Deeper LA in 2014, the parties poignantly helped usher the localized movement to showcase and welcome a global sequence of talent to the Los Angeles underground. DJ Sprinkles, K-Hand, Daniele Baldelli, Axel Boman, Bradley Zero, Shanti Celeste and Lena Willikens are just some of the notable faces to pull the clubbers in. Most recently, Masha co-created the impeccable open-air series Take It Outside, with its string of guests being of the highest order, from DJ Harvey to Honey Dijon, DJ Minx, Anz, Gerd Janson and Massimiliano Pagliara.\n\nSuffice to say, Masha stays fiercely engaged, locked and channeling the eclectic sounds that she loves.",
