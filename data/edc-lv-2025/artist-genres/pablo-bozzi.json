  "name": "Pablo Bozzi",
  "cleanBio": "Over the past couple years, it seems everyone has turned their gaze towards Pablo Bozzi. The Berlin-by-way-of-Toulouse producer and DJ has taken the club scene by storm with releases he’s coined Italo Body Music. The particular concoction of Italo Disco melodies overtop the brutality of an EBM beat—often a funky groove but with an edge—boast the precision of Bozzi’s productions that derive from his classical music background. If anything, Bozzi is prolific in his mastery of hybrid dance genres, most recently with the EPs Ghost of Chance (Dischi Autunno) and Magnetisma (Bite Records), along with his first full-length album, Street Reign on Pinkman—each released in 2022.",
