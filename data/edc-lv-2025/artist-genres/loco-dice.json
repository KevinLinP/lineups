As well as heading up the long-running and agenda setting label Desolat, and the newly minted En Couleur which explores a wide sphere of electronic sound, he also runs his own Ser√°n Bendecidos party series, which is built around the concept of unity, community and freedom. As a revered producer, he has put out essential albums and EPs that exist in their own world somewhere between house and techno. He has designed catwalk music for international fashion labels, his own merchandise lines and collaborations with major International brands, played sold out world tours and held era-defining residencies at some of the world's most iconic clubs, collaborated with some of the music industry's biggest names and also cooks up his own ideal fusions of hip hop and electronic music with his FKD side-project. He is, undoubtedly, an unstoppable creative force.",
