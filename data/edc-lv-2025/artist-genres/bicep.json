  "name": "Bicep",
  "cleanBio": "Belfast-born/London-based duo Bicep (Matt McBriar & Andy Ferguson) are childhood friends who bonded over a shared love of dance music. In the decades since first meeting, aged 8, Bicep have become one of the world’s most avidly appreciated curators & producers of electronic music.\n\nRecently hailed by the BBC as “one of the biggest names in UK dance”, Bicep continue to cement themselves as one of the defining global electronic acts of our times. Their most recent release “Water” was described as nothing short of “anthemic” by Mixmag, & saw Billboard opine that the duo “consistently creates some of the most powerful electronic atmospheres on the market”, as well as commending their “mind-blowing live performances.”\n\nIn 2022 Bicep played their biggest UK Live shows to date with back-to-back performances at London’s 10k capacity Alexandra Palace — both of which sold out in just 5 minutes — a headline arena-tour throughout Europe including Zenith Paris, Lotto Arena Antwerp & UFO Velodrom Berlin, & a run of high-profile festival & headline shows across North America. They will also embark on a sold-out tour of Australia in the new year including stops in Sydney, Melbourne, & Brisbane.\n\nBicep released their hotly anticipated second album, ‘Isles’, in January 2021, which debuted at #2 on the UK Official Albums Chart & #1 on the UK Official Vinyl Albums Chart, earning the duo 2x BRITs nominations in the process.",
