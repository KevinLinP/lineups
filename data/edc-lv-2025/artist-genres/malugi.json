  "name": "MALUGI",
  "cleanBio": "When witnessing one of his DJ sets, one can tell that he follows this path with the utmost devotion: Wether on his own or with his frequent b2b partner Marlon Hoffstadt, MALUGI knows how to drive dancefloors into a frenzy, bringing the word “rave“ back to its original meaning through an unapologetic, if not irresponsible use of the most outrageous bangers and belters around – in Germany we would say “dumm gehen“.\n\nThrough various highly acclaimed releases he has become synonymous with effective, turbocharged beats that will restore your batteries in an instant. His multidimensional approach to music and his entanglement with various styles and flavours speak of an open-mindedness rarely found in an industry often restricted by narrow perspectives on “good“ taste.\n\nConsequently, he has mastered the art of serious fun – while he takes his work as a DJ and producer very serious, he always leaves room for play. It is this particular intersection that allows for a holistic and ultimately worthwhile outlook on what the club ought to be: a space for coming together, letting go and most importantly, enjoying yourself.",
