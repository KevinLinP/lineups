  "name": "Trivecta",
  "cleanBio": "Sam Dobkin, better known as Trivecta, is a dance music producer and songwriter from Tampa, FL. He’s stylistically known for creating melodic trance, dubstep, bass, and drumstep music.\n\nWith the self-described goal of “making dubstep beautiful again,” he’s made a name for himself ever since with tracks that land in a compelling place between melodic dubstep, trance, bass and drumstep. In addition to receiving support from artists like Excision, The Chainsmokers and Don Diablo, he’s joined melodic bass connoisseurs such as Illenium, Seven Lions, Dabin, Kill The Noise, and Wooli on tour and landed official remixes with them – his take on Illenium’s “Fractures” has drawn over 5 million listens across streaming services alone. More recently, he collaborated with Excision & Wooli on “Oxygen” featuring Julianne Hope, which has already amassed nearly half a million streams with support from UKF & MrSuicideSheep. Both his remixes and original work have drawn attention from the most crucial tastemakers in the game, including Dancing Astronaut, EDM Sauce, MrSuicideSheep, and more.\n\nPaving a unique lane for himself in the world of electronic music, Trivecta certainly shows no signs of slowing down, with plenty more in store for 2021.",
