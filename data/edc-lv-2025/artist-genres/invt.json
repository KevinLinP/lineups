  "name": "INVT",
  "cleanBio": "INVT is the multidisciplinary art project of Luca Medici and Delbert Perez. The duo specialize in electronic music and fashion design. Their sound consists of a mix of Garage, Dubstep, Techno and various forms of Latin bass music, like Dembow, Cumbia, and Reggaeton. Luca and Delbert have grown their audience through their high energy live sets as seen at Fabric and Panorama Bar, as well as their DJ sets and various independent releases that are all produced, mixed, and mastered by the two. In addition to their music, Luca and Delbert have launched a sustainable clothing project in which they repurpose vintage clothing through screen-printing, embroidery, cut and sew, and acid washing. Every piece is a one of a kind garment made by hand in Miami by Luca and Delbert. Their designs and stylistic choices, such as the color schemes and graphics, are highly influenced by Miamiâ€™s unique environment. Many of the silk screen designs are photoshop collages made from photos they have taken in Miami. Many of these designs are also seen in cover art for their music which is also designed by them.",
