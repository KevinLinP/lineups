  "cleanBio": "Over the years the Canadian group Black Tiger Sex Machine have established themselves as key figures in the bass music scene. Along with their music BTSM pushes the boundaries of what a live show can be, implementing an extremely immersive experience where visuals, lights, music and their signature Tiger Helmets are all controlled live. Their grassroots approach has fostered an extraordinarily faithful fan base called the BTSM Church.\n\nIn 2023 they debuted their PORTALS show while headlining Ultra Miami and subsequently sold out every tour stop including The Armory and Brooklyn Mirage where PORTALS was shown in 4K Ultra Wide. This new live experience utilizes state-of-the-art motion capture visuals to expand on BTSM’s fictional storied universe.\n\nBTSM also manage Kannibalen Records, which has quickly become one of the top independent labels in dance music. Through Kannibalen they’ve shaped the careers of breakthrough artists like Apashe, Kai Wachi, Dabin, and more. Kannibalen Records has been recognized worldwide through major publication partnerships with Apple, Budweiser, adidas, T-Mobile, PS5, Fifa 2021, Netflix, Marvel, NBA, HBO, MTV, UFC, and more.",
