  "name": "Villager",
  "cleanBio": "Villager is a new DJ project from Alex Young. After touring as a DJ from ages 15-19, playing with the likes of DJs such as Skrillex, Diplo, Cashmere Cat, Kaytranada and many more, Alex decided to remove himself from the scene in order to take the next steps to grow as an artist. Born out the desire to create tracks and live experiences that push the threshold of different styles, and a philosophy of unadulterated creative expression, Alex has spent the last few years honing in the craft and building up a big collection of music, with the first releases now coming out.",
