  "name": "Dennis Cruz",
  "cleanBio": "Dennis Cruz is one of the pillars of the underground house and tech community. As a DJ and producer, he continually sets trends with his fresh sounds and, off the back of a year that saw him feature in and get critical praise from tastemakers like Mixmag and DJ Mag, he has plenty more in store for the world in the next 12 months.   The Spaniard is never far away from the top of the charts thanks to his high rate of release on labels like Solid Grooves, Lemon-Aid, Snatch! amongst many others. For his work he has picked up many awards and nominations from being Best Producer at the DJ Awards 2017 to Beatport’s 3rd Best Tech House Artist to Resident Advisor’s 2nd Most Charted Artist of 2016. He has had many Number 1s on Beatport and is currently top of the overall Tech House Chart. Also, he has been nominated for two years straight as Best Tech House artist and Best DJ at the Vicious Awards. Always serving up dancing dynamite, it is no wonder he has found favour with big hitters like Jamie Jones, Roger Sanchez or Marco Carola, all of whom reach for his tunes when they need to make an impact.",
