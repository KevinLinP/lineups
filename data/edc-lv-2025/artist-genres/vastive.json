  "cleanBio": "Ranging from the power of dub to the energy of drum and bass and everything in between, Vastive hails from the east coast known as the “Bully on the Block”. Solidified on the grounds of all things bass and metal, the #bullyontheblock has set forth a vision to bring home the balance between sanity and chaos.\n\nIn the booth or on the decks; pure and raw emotion fueled by the sounds of peace and absolute destruction are to be expected. With roots as the lead singer in a metal band, Vastive is no stranger of playing in front of a crowd and putting on a stellar performance.\n\nAlongside Vastive’s impressive composition and skillful production, he strives to include his vocals in his tracks to help set him apart from the rest. Vastive’s fresh take on bass music has landed him releases on Never Say Die, Subsidia, Space Yacht Records and more, while receiving support from industry heavyweights such as Excision, Riot Ten, Sullivan King, PhaseOne, Calcium, Oddprophet and the list keeps going. With an impressive resume and no plans on slowing down, Vastive is here to make his mark in the bass music community and beyond.",
