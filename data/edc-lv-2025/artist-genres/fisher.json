  "cleanBio": "Known for his wild sense of humor and energetic DJing style, FISHER has become one of the scene’s most in-demand talents - sending him to the spotlight, his breakout track ‘Losing It’ earned him his first Grammy nomination. Fast-forward to 2023 and the track has now amassed well over half a billion streams, cementing its status as one of the biggest dance records of the decade in the process.\n\nRecently releasing records such as ‘Yeah The Girls’ and ‘Take It Off’, the mega dance hit with AATIG, which achieved placement on BBC Radio 1 ‘B List’ Playlist, and has over 50 million streams on Spotify since its summer release. Riding high on a hype wave since his scene-stealing performance at Coachella, FISHER’s new single is already being touted as one of the dance anthems of the summer from its explosion on TikTok. Combining soaring synths and Kita Alexander’s irresistibly catchy lead vocal over a pulsating uptempo groove, ‘Atmosphere’ has amassed 3 Million Spotify streams in its first week and is showing no signs of slowing down.\n\nFISHER is on a roll this year, with a weekly Hi Ibiza residency, his TAO Vegas residency and appearances including headlining Outside Lands and We Are FSTVL to name a few. FISHER's first curated festival TRIIP in Malta also took place in June, with a huge lineup featuring Claptone, Eats Everything, Loco Dice and many more.",
