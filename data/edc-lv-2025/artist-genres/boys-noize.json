  "name": "Boys Noize",
  "cleanBio": "BOYS NOIZE (Alex Ridha) builds worlds, then builds bridges between them. Propelled by an infatuation with sonic invention and a prescience for subculture, the German-Iraqi artist, DJ and producer has developed a peerless practice that is both deeply informed by electronic music history and determinedly transcending conventions. As an international festival headliner and A-list producer, BOYS NOIZE embodies the transformation and expansion of 21st century techno, house and electro into the current zeitgeist, and he has the GRAMMY win to prove it. Yet as a Berliner and lifelong DJ, he remains dedicated to the underground, regularly flexing the decks at techno meccas and experimenting through a multiplicity of multi-genre aliases. Some fans find BOYS NOIZE through his productions for A$AP ROCKY and FRANK OCEAN, or his film scores for OLIVER STONE's \"Snowden\"; through his house hit \"Mvinline\", or his collaborative projects OCTAVE MINDS and DOG BLOOD with SKRILLEX, as well as an EP and OFF-WHITE capsule collection with VIRGIL ABLOH; through his remixes for DAFT PUNK, YEAH YEAH YEAHs and DEPECHE MODE, his features with RICO NASTY, PUSSY RIOT and KELSEY LU, or reworks of SHYGIRL, SEGA BODEGA and SOPHIE; through this yearâ€™s blazing run of 140+ bpm techno tracks and remixes, or the massive \"Fine Day Anthem\" with SKRILLEX. BOYS NOIZE's most important collaboration of all, however, is with the ravers that join him across the globe from basements to warehouses to the main stage.",
