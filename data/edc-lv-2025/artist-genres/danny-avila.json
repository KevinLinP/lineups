  "name": "Danny Avila",
  "cleanBio": "To have achieved what Danny Avila has at the age of 26 is phenomenal enough. With a feisty production sound and an unique DJ style, he is a breath of fresh air in a world where many artists are happy to stick to the same formula. In Danny’s eyes, DJing is a form of art, hence the variety of genres from techno to big-room and from tech-house to trap, always finding a way to take people on a journey. In 2017, he made the highest re-entry to the DJ Mag Top100 DJs 2017 poll at # 52, while in 2021 reaching # 34, still being the highest ranked Spanish DJ ever. His music has been released on major labels including SONY, Interscope, Musical Freedom, Spinnin’ Records, Ultra Music, Hexagon and Heartfeldt Records. Or on Armada Music, like ‘Mother & Father’ (feat. Bukhu) - his first single from his new, dark and edgy sound style project „Mainstage Techno“, an insanely energetic mix of state-of-the-art elements of techno music paired with full-on, cutting-edge progressive features. On top of a history of hundreds of million streams and weekly radio shows, he also counts three compilations to his name: ‘Ministry of Sound presents: Danny Avila Live’, Space Ibiza’s ‘Ibiza Calling’ and DJ Mag UK Danny Avila’s Big Room Mix. Danny was the youngest artist to ever make the cover mount CD for DJ Mag UK. To top of his extremely long list of musical achievements, Danny Avila has collaborated with world-renowned fashion brands New Yorker, and tigha, who approached him due to his extravagant style.",
