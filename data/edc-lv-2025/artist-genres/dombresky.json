  "cleanBio": "Although he hails from the south of France, Dombresky’s penchant for invigorating four- on-the-floor beats is pure house bliss. The DJ and producer burst onto the scene in 2016 when he arrived in Miami as Quentin Dombres, a then-unknown talent with an impressive roster of funky, feel-good tracks. Today he has become inextricably linked with industry heavyweights including Blondish, Armand van Helden, Diplo, Claptone, and MK, all of whom supported Dombresky’s early career endeavors as collaborators. With jazz-tinged, hypnotic songs like “Soul Sacrifice” earning over 50 million streams and counting, and becoming one of Beatport’s top selling artists, it’s clear that Dombresky has set himself apart from the rest. Just a few years after arriving in the States and starting his career from scratch, Dombresky has hit career milestones that most DJs only dream of, playing Lollapalooza, headlining Snowglobe and Countdown NYE, selling out famous venues including the Shrine Auditorium and the Hollywood Palladium, and growing a loyal fanbase that nets him millions of streams per month.\n\nNow, Dombresky has gone global, playing sold-out venues across the country, to the hottest clubs of Ibiza and Dubai, and he shows no signs of slowing down. In 2023 he is slated to return to Coachella and continues to broadcast his passion project, Process Radio, which won him an Electronic Dance Music Award for best radio show. He isn’t just stopping there. Expanding the Process name, Dombresky is thrilled to launch Process Records, which will allow him to take ownership of his masters and mentor up- and-coming talents.",
