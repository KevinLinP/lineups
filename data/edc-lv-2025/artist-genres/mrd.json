  "name": "MRD",
  "cleanBio": "MRD is one of the most exciting things to happen to the Norwegian club scene for ages. In the space of just two years he has already released one album and six singles. Now another album is ready to go. MRD is clearly a hard working producer/DJ: with a bunch of hardcore releases in his rucksack, as well as a ferocious live set, 2019 looks set to be MRD's year. His sound is melodic, uncompromising, nostalgic, hard and honest, with a mix of new wave, hardcore, ambient, and banging dark techno.",
