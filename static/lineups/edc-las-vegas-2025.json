      "bio": "Multi-platinum DJ / producer Alesso is a global sensation who’s repeatedly proven that his influence transcends universal boundaries. A pivotal name in electronic music, Alesso has amassed two RIAA-certified Platinum hits, two certified Gold singles, over 5.5 billion global streams, and countless collaborations throughout the span of his iconic career. With a diehard fanbase that reaches across the world, Alesso continues to be a symbol of musical excellence in electronic music and beyond.\n\nBorn Alessandro Lindblad in Stockholm Sweden, Alesso quickly gained mainstream recognition for his remixes of Tiësto, Swedish House Mafia, and Avicii before becoming a household name for his own productions. Upon the release of just his second single, 2012’s “Calling (Losing My Mind)” with Swedish House Mafia’s Sebastian Ingrosso and OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder, he was certified 2X Platinum in Sweden while also reaching no. 1 on Billboard’s US Hot Dance Club Songs. In 2014, he went Platinum in the U.S. with “Heroes (we could be)” featuring Tove Lo. His 2014 album Forever, hit #1 on Billboard’s Top Dance/Electronic Albums and #30 on the Billboard 200. Since his debut, Alesso has proven that his music can seamlessly cross over into countless genres - to that end, he’s collaborated with such eclectic artists as Katy Perry, OneRepublic’s Ryan Tedder, Calvin Harris, Tove Lo, Liam Payne, James Bay, Marshmello, Swedish House Mafia’s Sebastian Ingrosso, Hailee Steinfeld, Florida Georgia Line, Anitta, and more. On Billboard’s Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart, his massive breakup anthem “Let Me Go” — a collaboration with Hailee Steinfeld and Florida Georgia Line — reached No. 9, while “Is That For Me” peaked at No. 25.\n\nIn 2020, Alesso released a pair of hit singles: “Midnight” featuring Liam Payne and “THE END” with goth-pop singer/songwriter Charlotte Lawrence. Soon after, he dropped his cosmic love ballad “Chasing Stars (with Marshmello feat. James Bay),”the dynamic “Rescue Me (with Danna Paola)” from the Blade Runner Black Lotus soundtrack, and his winter floor-filler “Somebody To Use.”\n\nTo cap off 2021, Alesso made his NFT debut with the Cosmic Genesis collection and dropped “When I’m Gone” — his colossal collaboration with Katy Perry. This primed fans for his 2022 releases including “Words,” a smash crossover hit with Zara Larsson, which was hailed by BILLBOARD as the top dance song of 2022. It even spawned an EP of remixes featuring artists like Chapter & Verse, Sentinel, Arodes, and Majestic. Alesso followed that up with the Sentinel- assisted house anthem “Only You” and “Dark,” an atmospheric track created for THE BATMAN movie. He finished out the year with “We Go Out,” an ecstatic dance track created with Sick Individuals. To date, Alesso has performed at international festivals ranging from Tomorrowland to Ultra Music Festival to Electric Daisy Carnival, with his national TV experience including closing out GMA’s Summer Concert Series, performing on “The Late Show with James Corden,” taking the stage at the AMAs and making his “Saturday Night Live” debut in January 2022 with Katy Perry.\n\nOver the last few years, Alesso has generated nearly 1B views on TikTok videos featuring his songs and over 2M followers on Instagram. He’s landed 3 songs (“Let Me Go,” “Heroes,” and “When I’m Gone”) on the Billboard Hot 100, and now also has over 16M followers across various social media platforms. Alesso continually pushes the boundaries with his ever-evolving sound, proving that his impact will remain as timeless as his music for generations to come. 125%",

      "name": "Alison Wonderland",
      "bio": "When it comes to making music, Alison Wonderland has always worn her heart on her sleeve. Her songwriting — visceral and raw — takes lines that feel like entries from her own diary and twists the familiar burns of heartache and hurt into empowering mantras for festival crowds around the world to sing along to. Her production is as explosive as it is delicate, channeling intricate, uncompromising beat work and blending in the unexpected, like cello breakdowns, amongst swinging trap, bass beats, and dynamic, futuristic soundscapes. Alison Wonderland is unapologetically herself and has shattered the status quo with her fearless approach to redefining what experimental pop electronic music can and should be.\n\nNever one to color in between the lines, Alison Wonderland has done things differently even from the onset of her musical career. In her formative years, she was a cellist with the Sydney Youth Orchestra by day, while moonlighting as a bass guitarist in local bands by night. Making her way around Sydney's nightlife circuit, she was eventually introduced to DJing and learned the magic of producing and making her own music.\n\nAlison Wonderland the project debuted in 2009 and her ascent since has been uncontainable. She rose up a beacon of Australia's vibrant electronic music scene, first garnering international recognition for her creative and genre-defying DJing while also carving out her role as a household name producer, starting with remixes for the likes of pop giants like Justin Bieber. Soon after, her talents as a triple threat producer, singer, and songwriter took center stage when she debuted with her album Run. Her debut album was her first to hit No. 1 at the top of Billboard's Top Dance/Electronic Albums Chart and was also nominated at the ARIA Awards. She then arrived in the US with a bang for her first performance stateside, landing on the stages of the hallowed Coachella. Typically, a Coachella performance is a milestone that takes a hopeful artist years and years to reach — for Alison, it was merely a marker of what was yet to come in her new home base in California. Only a few years later, she would go on to make history at the festival when she became the highest female DJ to be billed across all of Coachella's storied lineups.\n\nCementing her place as a champion of Australia's explosive pool of electronic talent and as a beloved headliner on festival billings was just the beginning. Alison Wonderland has also been recognized as Billboard's Breakout Artist of the Year, the Electronic Music Awards' Best New Artist, and received multiple nominations for her records at the ARIA Awards. Named by Billboard as a \"prodigious creative\" and described by The Fader as \"unexpected and amazing,\" it's clear that Alison Wonderland has created something special.\n\nHer 2018 album Awake was her second No. 1 Billboard Dance/Electronic Album chart-topper. The album saw her level up as a producer, working with a diverse array of revered collaborators like rap stars Trippie Redd and Chief Keef as well as producers for the stars Joel Little and Illangelo. Her subsequent tour hit historic venues across North America and included sold out nights at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, WaMu Theater, and two nights at the Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado.\n\nEverything has changed since Alison Wonderland released her last record in 2018. The world turned upside down when a global pandemic wiped out \"normal life\" as everyone knew it. Life, as it was, came to a screeching halt — especially a life full of live music, shows, and touring. Like many, Alison Wonderland found herself suddenly very still, and very alone.\n\n\"My life was going a certain way before something pulled everything out from under me,\" she describes. \"It left me entirely alone, and it all happened around the same time as COVID. I felt like I had hit my rock bottom.\" Having always turned to making music to process, she began to ruminate on the beginnings of her third album, Loner. Like rereading the pages of old diaries, she revisited her own albums for the first time in a long time. \"I realized that I have always seen myself as the victim of my story. This time, something shifted in me, and I decided that I didn't want to be the victim anymore. Instead, whatever I wrote from here would empower me, and help me find strength in this loneliness.\"\n\nThroughout her career, Alison has consistently been a courageous advocate for mental health discussions and her own struggles with depression. Staying true to her message with Loner, she writes with a captivating new assuredness in the light that comes after the storm. \"It's the most positive, hopeful album I have ever written,\" she shares. \"It acknowledges the darkness, but creates its own euphoria through it.\"\n\nLoner captures Alison Wonderland at her best; an exhilarating juxtaposition of lyrics and sound, the album is as bright as it is brash. Her songwriting, sharper than ever, is disarmingly genuine and wickedly clever. Longtime fans will know that Alison Wonderland has always faced her own experiences of loss, hurt, and unbridled passion head on through her music, but with Loner, there exists an undeniable new draw in her explorations of hope and perseverance. \"For me, Loner felt like a rebirth.\" With her latest, Alison Wonderland transforms darkness into light, disorder into order. \"I owe it to whoever else is out there who was like me, wishing that they had an album like this to empower them to feel less alone and know that it's all going to be okay one day,\" she says. In 2022, as we emerge from past years of cloudy, turbulent change, Loner has arrived just in time to remind us to look ahead to a better tomorrow.",

      "name": "Andy C",
      "bio": "With over 40 awards to date, Andy C's career has been nothing short of a phenomenon. He's sold-out Alexandra Palace and Brixton Academy with his own solo shows, played headline slots at the world's greatest festivals including Creamfields, Glastonbury, EDC, and SW4, and released a string of phenomenal crossover anthems like 'Heartbeat Loud' and club cuts like 'New Era'. He's also the go-to remixer for the likes of Major Lazer, Sigala, London Grammar and beyond, and the d&b figure recently chosen to host the first drum & bass radio show on Apple Music's Beats 1, broadcast to over 100 countries.\n\nA reputation as one of the most significant British artists in global dance music has been hard earned, but it's hard to place the tipping points. Was it his performance at Radio 1's Hackney weekend, where his set was watched online by more people than either Jay Z or Rihanna? When he performed to 85,000 people at Glastonbury in 2013? When he sold out Brixton Academy in 10 minutes? Or when his remix of Major Lazer charted on iTunes after being added to the Radio 1 Playlist?\n\nAndy's success and status as a festival main stage headliner and DJ who guarantees sell-out roadblocks is driven by a phenomenal work ethic and the kind of tour schedule that makes rock bands look like part-timers.\n\nAs the owner and figurehead for Ram Records, Andy's nurtured and developed huge headline artists such as Chase & Status, Wilkinson and Sub Focus, turning it into one of the world's most respected independent operations across recordings and now festivals like EDC Las Vegas, Creamfields, and SW4 where Ram have hosted their own arenas and stages.\n\nAndy's main signature motif as a DJ is that he's guaranteed to be packing tracks that no other DJ has. Hunting, digging, searching and signing: he is constantly immersed in new music. Not only does this ensure a wholly unique experience when you see him live, but it also gives Ram Records a front row seat when it comes to spotting new artists... As the likes of Loadstar, Wilkinson, Calyx & TeeBee, Frankee, Delta Heavy, Culture Shock, DC Breaks, Hamilton, Mind Vortex, Chords and many more exciting talents will happily confirm.\n\nOn 31 March, Andy completed his 13 week residency run at XOYO. The first d&b artist chosen by the renowned London club, tickets for his entire residency sold out far in advance. The Friday night run allowed Andy to nurture a weekly crowd on a par with his legendary sets at The End, bringing together older heads and d&b's new converts together under one roof.\n\nSummer 2017 festival dates include Lovebox, Let it Roll festival, Snowbombing, Lost & Found, Wild Life, Parklife, Dour Festival, Nu Forms, Boardmasters, Dreambeach, Innovation in the Sun, Tomorrowland, Reading Festival, Leeds Festival, Bestival, Middlelands and many more to be announced.\n\nAndy's latest club track 'What Bass', his first new music in 12 months, is available now on Ram Records. Further releases are set for the rest of the year.",

      "name": "Armin van Buuren",
      "bio": "This is a man driven by an unbridled and relentless passion for music. Armin van Buuren is a born perfectionist, striving to stay on top of the scene he’s helped build. As the flag-bearer of the trance movement, he’s one of the most influential figures in EDM worldwide. Even though he lives an extraordinary life as one of the world’s most popular DJs, he has always remained a down-to-earth guy. Armin van Buuren is constantly on the move, whether creating music in his studio or en route to his next high-end club or festival show around the globe.\n\nArmin: “It’s not just love for music, it’s my passion. It goes beyond liking, and beyond a hobby. It’s about a way of living. Music is essential to my life.”\n\nFor more than twenty years, the Grammy-nominated Dutchman has been living to the rhythm of his own international success. His five-time number one position in the critically acclaimed DJ Mag Top 100 DJs poll has been the result of his loyalty to fans, his creativity in the studio, the perseverance with which he hosts his weekly radio show ‘A State of Trance’ and the energy he brings to the crowds in front of him. Despite the heavy pressure that comes with being one of the world’s most popular DJs, Armin has always kept his focus on the music. And that’s exactly what keeps him going.\n\nHOW IT ALL BEGAN\n\nBorn in Leiden, the Netherlands (December 25, 1976) to a musical family, Armin indulged his passion for music from a young age. He spent all of the money he earned from his paper route on records. His mom won a computer when he was 10, piquing Armin’s interest in technology. “So as a little nerdy kid I was writing my own basic programs and learnt about the technology from there.” Armin progressed from making low-profile mix tapes for friends to high-end mixes when he started experimenting with different sequences on his computer through his uncle. “I was so stunned by what I saw him doing on the computer that I got addicted to creating music right there and then!”\n\n“I loved dance music immediately – this great rebellious sound that was so different from the ‘beautiful’ songs of the years before.” Armin cites electronic pioneer Jean-Michel Jarre as a major influence, as well as Dutch producer Ben Lie-brand, who later mentored him in his mixing and producing.\n\nIn the early days, Armin thought it was wise to have a back-up plan, and so he studied for a law degree. The final year of his course was inevitably stretched out as he juggled his studies with his increasingly hectic schedule; his rise to fame included lots of productions and remixes, as well as playing in front of packed clubs every weekend. It took him three years to graduate, but his determination made him succeed.\n\nDespite having a Master’s degree in Law, the main ingredient in Armin’s life has always been music. Armin: “I see it as my responsibility to promote trance as a genre, and I want to support it in every way I can. Music should connect us. As long as the music keeps evolving like it is, I will continue and I don’t see any reason to slow down.”\n\nTHE DJ\n\nNo matter how many hours Armin van Buuren has travelled to get there, as soon as he enters the DJ booth, the Dutch-man puts his full focus on the music, the crowd and how those two will combine. Once the beats of his first record kick in, the room lights up and chanting starts to fill the air. To witness a set by Armin van Buuren is to be blown away — to lose yourself completely in the music and become one with the people around you. Mixing seamlessly, he has created his own sound and style, making his DJ sets a truly unique experience. He unites millions, not only through the gigs in his challenging schedule, but also through his ‘Armin Only’ and ‘A State of Trance’ world tours.\n\nHis busy life as a DJ has inspired countless people both personally and professionally. In 2009, Dutch author Coen Bom presented his on-the-road biography of Armin called ‘Eén op één’ / ‘Armin Only’, in which he reported on the hectic life of Armin and tried to find the secret behind the grand success of the humble Dutchman. In October 2012, the official documentary ‘A Year With Armin van Buuren’ was released, in which Armin was followed during an important year in his life, offering a unique look behind the scenes and inside his personality. Again and again, his life as a superstar DJ con-tinues to inspire others.\n\nArmin has the privilege of performing at some of the world’s biggest and best festivals, clubs, events and shows. One of the highlights of his career was performing for the newly crowned King and Queen of the Netherlands in 2013, Willem-Alexander and Máxima. Together with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and in front of the monarchs and 15,000 fans, he performed both ‘The Bolero’ as well as an orchestral version of the title track from his ‘Intense’ album. During the ‘Koningsvaart’ (a special, cultural boat trip through the city of Amsterdam), the King and Queen surprised both the crowd and Armin by getting on stage and dancing along with him.\n\nAnother memorable highlight of Armin’s career was his DJ set at the Museumplein in Amsterdam in July of 2010, during the ceremonial honoring of the Dutch national soccer team. Even though the national team lost in the FIFA World Cup final, they partied like they were the absolute winners with a crowd of 200,000 strong.\n\nIn 2013, Armin’s career hit a new milestone when he became the first solo dance artist to play in Madison Square Gar-den. The event was completely sold out, representing another crowning achievement for the DJ.\n\nAfter the 2013 summer season had ended (along with his residency at the world’s biggest club, Privilege in Ibiza), Armin kicked off a new ‘Armin Only’ world tour based on his ‘Intense’ album, in collaboration with theatre director Jos Thie. More than 33 dates were set, with shows landing in cities such as Kiev, Mumbai, Saint-Petersburg, Helsinki, New York, Toronto, Mexico City, Sydney, Johannesburg, and more. With the ‘Armin Only’ tour, Armin brandished a unique and ex-clusive show format, which unfolded like the many layers of his ‘Intense’ album. In total, more than 500,000 visitors at-tended, spanning 5 continents. A ‘Road Movie’ series was also created, documenting behind-the-scenes footage of the entire tour as it took place.\n\nIn 2014, Armin began a highly successful weekly residency at the famous Ushuaïa Beach Hotel in Ibiza, playing every Thursday night from June 26th to September 11th alongside top DJs from the Armada Music roster. After the residency, he released a compilation entitled ‘A State of Trance at Ushuaïa Ibiza’ to commemorate the season. As if to underline the success of the residency, Armin returned to the Ushuaïa Beach Hotel a year later for another ‘A State Of Trance at Ushuaïa, Ibiza’ summer. His performances in the center of the Ushuaïa pool were met with wide-spread passion and enthusiasm amongst his fans, subsequently leading to the release of the second volume of his Ushuaïa compilation series: ‘A State Of Trance at Ushuaïa, Ibiza 2015’.\n\nOn January 26th, 2016, Armin van Buuren announced the first two dates of his brand-new Armin Only Embrace world tour, to which even more dates were added later on through a live announcement at A State Of Trance Festival Utrecht on February 27th. ‘Armin Only: Embrace’ has since seen a spectacular kick-off in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and has brought a spectacular offering to other cities, including Gdansk (Poland), Dubai (UAE), Sofia (Bulgaria), Minsk (Belarus), and Mexico City (Mexico and more.\n\nIn 2017, on Friday, May 12th and Saturday, May 13th, Armin van Buuren celebrated his twenty-year anniversary as an artist in one of the most prestigious venues of the Netherlands. Both shows in the Amsterdam ArenA sold out in no time, which allowed Armin van Buuren to celebrate the special occasion with tens of thousands of his most loyal fans and to create a memory able to withstand the test of time.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, Armin van Buuren returned to the White Isle for another highly anticipated summer residency. Gracing Hï Ibiza - one of Ibiza’s newest and hottest clubs - with sublime Wednesday Night shows alongside fellow-Dutchmen and friends Sunnery James & Ryan Marciano, Armin van Buuren does what he does best: rousing crowds beyond belief and giving them the time of their lives for the full duration of the show.\n\nAt the start of 2018, Armin van Buuren announced his return to Hï Ibiza alongside Sunnery James & Ryan Marciano to dive into the Ibiza madness for another glorious summer chock-full of stellar club performances and epic festival live sets, such as the seven-hour-long live set at Untold Festival in Romania. One year later, in 2019, Armin van Buuren still heads up the Wednesday Night shows at Hï Ibiza during the summer.\n\nIn 2022, two years later than originally planned due to the Corona pandemic, Armin van Buuren will play his most per-sonal and intimate live shows yet through four sold-out shows in the Ziggo Dome: ‘This Is Me’.\n\nTHE RADIO HOST\n\nWhat started as an obsession for radio has turned into a weekly highlight for more than 44 million listeners, broadcast-ing to over 100 FM stations and fans from 80+ countries. In June 2001, Armin van Buuren aired the first episode of ‘A State of Trance’. Eighteen years later, he still hosts the weekly two-hour show, where he presents the biggest tunes of the moment and provides an interactive way for fans to discover new music. Regular features of the show are the ‘Tune of the Week’, ‘Progressive Pick’, ‘Service For Dreamers’ and the ‘Future Favorite’, the latter of which is based on an online voting poll.\n\nCelebrating each milestone, Armin did an extensive world tour based around the 650th episode of ASOT in early 2014. The ‘New Horizons’ world tour landed in the cities of Moscow, Yekaterinburg, Almaty, Utrecht, Santiago, Buenos Aires, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, and Miami. The 8-week tour took place in January, February, and March of 2014 and included nine shows in countries all around the globe, with events broadcast live on the A State of Trance website.\n\nIn continuation of the success of ASOT, Armin kicked off his A State of Trance Festival tour. ASOT Festival was a new concept developed for 2015 in conjunction with ASOT Episode #700. Armin van Buuren became the first DJ to have his own festival: the biggest trance festival tour in history. The tour invaded Utrecht, Buenos Aires, Ultra Music Festival in Miami, Sydney and Melbourne, Mexico, and other destinations worldwide. Episode #700 was also the first time that an entirely fan-created show was used, with fans being given the chance to present their favorite tracks on air. Fans were asked to submit voice recordings of themselves introducing their favorite trance tracks of all time, and the resultant songs and recordings were used to create an entirely fan-made episode, which marked the first time in the world a major dance radio show has ever done this.\n\nAfter very successful editions of ASOT 750, ASOT 800 and ASOT 850, the A State Of Trance event series hit ASOT 900 on a high note, celebrating no less than 900 episodes of the radio show with a huge event in Utrecht, the Netherlands, which attracted a crowd of 33.000 strong. ASOT 950 naturally followed suit one year later, and Armin van Buuren’s in-ternationally acclaimed radio show has since surpassed the milestone number of 1000 episodes, with an epic ASOT 1000 celebration weekend scheduled for February 2020.\n\nReflecting upon the ‘A State of Trance’ world tours, Armin says: “I’m deeply honored by all the positive things that are happening for the show and for the sound in general. I’ve always said ASOT is not only a show for, but also a show by the fans. The show wouldn’t be where it is without the fans, so it feels amazing to see so many people celebrating along. It’s crazy to see groups of fans going crazy to the same music that we’re playing on the other side of the world. People wearing banners, flags, and making their own private party. This is what I meant with ‘turning the world into a dance floor’.”\n\nEach year, the listeners of the show are asked to vote for their favorite records of the year, with the ‘A State of Trance Top 20’ as the official result. Each track on this list ends up in the ‘A State of Trance Year Mix’, released at the end of December. Weeks of editing and mixing come together in a two-hour mega mix showcasing over a hundred tracks and countless memories. Several hundred thousand copies of the series have been sold to date, and the series has been going strong for almost fifteen years. Another series that Armin has linked to the radio show is the ‘A State of Trance Classics’ compilation. After years of providing some of the most essential classics and all-time favorites in EDM, the series continues to commemorate the early days of dance music. Furthermore, Armin was awarded 4x certified Plati-num for his ASOT Year Mix series in late 2014.\n\nIn addition to the radio show, Armin started the weekly ‘A State of Trance Podcast’ with a selection from the previous episode of the radio show, ensuring that listeners never miss out on any highlights. Every Sunday, Armin also hosts a 24-hour radio day called ‘A State of Sundays’, broadcast on one of the biggest radio stations in the United States: Sirius XM Satellite Radio. In addition to the A State of Trance shows, A State of Sundays also introduces its listeners to the sets and radio shows of other popular DJs and talented artists.\n\nIn 2017, Armin van Buuren opened a brand-new radio studio in the HQ of Armada Music in Amsterdam, from which all latest episodes of A State Of Trance are broadcast in audio and video.\n\nTHE PRODUCER\n\nWhenever he’s not on tour or having a daddy day with his daughter Fenna and son Remy, Armin locks himself up in the studio. Giving meaning to his famous quote “Don’t be a prisoner of your own style”, he explores the boundaries of EDM through his originals and remixes. Some of his most beloved works, such as ‘Communication’, ‘Burned With Desire’, ‘Blue Fear’, ‘Shivers’, and ‘Yet Another Day’, have grown into highly revered classics, withstanding the test of time.\n\nArmin van Buuren can now look back on the success of his ‘76’ (2003), ‘Shivers’ (2005), ‘Imagine’ (2008), ‘Mirage’ (2010), ‘Intense’ (2013) and ‘Embrace’ (2015) albums, whilst gearing up for the release of his seventh artist album, ‘Balance’, on October 25, 2019. ‘Intense’ was nominated for the Dutch Edison Pop Award for ‘Best Dance Album’. The follow-up to his ‘Mirage’ album featured collaborations with Israeli violinist Miri Ben-Ari, Australian duo NERVO, and singers like Trevor Guthrie, Emma Hewitt, Laura Jansen, Fiora, and more. ‘This Is What It Feels Like’ ft. Trevor Guthrie (the first single off the album) was nominated for the Grammy award for ‘Best Dance Recording’ and also received a nomination for a Canadi-an Juno Award. It became a worldwide hit, reaching A-List rotation on radio stations all across the globe and receiving silver, gold, platinum, and double platinum certifications in countries such as Canada, the Netherlands, the UK, Australia, and Italy. The video has reached over 64 million views to date.\n\nAfter indulging his fans with a fresh Armin van Buuren presents Rising Star record (‘Safe Inside You’ feat. Betsie Larkin), an official remix of the ‘Game Of Thrones Theme’, and a collaboration with Electronic Music pioneer Jean-Michel Jarre (‘Stardust’), Armin announced the name of his forthcoming artist album during his ASOT radio show on Thursday, Sep-tember 3, 2015.\n\n‘Embrace’ emerged as Armin’s sixth full-length artist album on October 29, filled with remarkable collaborations with the likes of Mr. Probz (‘Another You’), Hardwell (‘Off The Hook’), Cimo Fränkel (‘Strong Ones’), world-famous Dutch Jazz trumpeter Eric Vloeimans (‘Embrace’) award-winning Dutch band Kensington (‘Heading Up High’), U.K. singer-songwriter BullySongs (‘Freefall’ and ‘Caught In The Slipstream’) and fellow Grammy nominee Gavin DeGraw (‘Looking For Your Name’).\n\nSaid Armin of the stylistic diversity of ‘Embrace’, “Each of the instruments you see on the album cover – which was shot by Anton Corbijn – was an instrument actually used on the album! I thought it would be a real challenge to myself to try to create dance music using all of these disparate instruments. I really wanted to push myself past my comfort zone and create something very exciting not just for me, but for all the lovers of music out there. I hope you enjoy it.” Judging by the ecstatic reaction of audiences whenever Armin plays his album cuts onstage, he has, once again, succeeded.\n\nIn August 2016, Armin van Buuren put out his ‘Old Skool’ mini album. Inspired by the track ‘Old Skool’ on the ‘Embrace’ album, Armin van Buuren went on to revamp timeless classics such as Human Resource – ‘Dominator’, The Ultimate Seduction – ‘The Ultimate Seduction’, Speedy J – ‘Pull Over’, and more. The result, a seven-piece mini album, takes his fans back to where it all started by brandishing a piece of dance music history.\n\nAlways striving to step out of his comfort zone, Armin van Buuren turned 2017 into an excellent year by dropping three summer-flavored smashes: ‘I Need You’ (with Garibay feat. Olaf Blackwood), ‘Sunny Days’ (feat. Josh Cumbee) and ‘You Are’ with Sunnery James & Ryan Marciano, the anthem for their joint summer residency at Hï Ibiza. And if that didn’t prove versatile enough, he dove into previous uncharted territory with his first single of 2018: ‘Sex, Love & Water’ (feat. Conrad Sewell), a delicious mash of funk and disco. The rest of 2018 saw him deliver more amazing pop-dance singles in the form of ‘Therapy’ and ‘Wild Wild Son’, but also saw him dive into his Trance roots with tremor-like festival anthems such as ‘The Last Dancer’ with Shapov, the gimmicky ‘Blah Blah Blah’, ‘Our Origin’ (also with Shapov) and the sublime ‘United’, a high-intensity anthem made in collaboration with Vini Vici and Alok. In 2019, Armin van Buuren continued where he left off, releasing more powerful bangers (e.g. ‘Turn It Up’, ‘Show Me Love’ (with Above & Beyond)) and lovely crossbreed singles (e.g. ‘Lonely For You’ (feat. Bonnie McKee), ‘Don’t Give Up On Me’ (with Lucas & Steve feat. Josh Cumbee)). It shows just how open-minded Armin van Buuren is and that’s exactly what made him remain a top player to this day.\n\nOn October 25, Armin van Buuren released his seventh artist album, ‘Balance’. The album consists of 28 tracks, and includes well-known singles such as ‘Blah Blah Blah’, ‘Sunny Days’ and ‘Phone Down’ as well as new collaborations with the likes of NE-YO (‘Unlove You’), MatLuck (‘Don’t Let Me Go’) and Tempo Giusto (‘Mr. Navigator’). Armin van Buuren even launched his own limited-time ‘Balance’ escape room in Amsterdam to celebrate the release of the album.\n\nAs stated by Armin van Buuren, the album is about thinking in possibilities rather than definition, thinking about what music could be instead of what it should be. “Every song I make teaches me something new, and the next song is always a result of all my previous records, the new things I learned and the people I met”, the world-renowned DJ and producer says in the foreword of his album. “Over the years, this process - and especially the fun of creating - became more and more important to me. It’s a journey that gives me meaning and helps me learn more about my personal interests ra-ther than focus on the recognition I get for the outcome. That’s the big difference between who I am today and who I was a few years ago. ‘BALANCE’ is a new chapter in my book of life, the result of venturing into known and unknown territories while finding the balance in between. This creative journey gives me the energy to do what I do, to keep go-ing.”\n\nIn 2020, Armin van Buuren continued to put out more admirable creations. Among those are his ‘RELAXED’ chill album, which features acoustic versions and chill remixes of some of his biggest tracks to date, and ‘All On Me’, his genre-crossing single with Hardstyle pioneer Brennan Heart.\n\nIn 2021, Armin van Buuren not only released his first-ever collab with Swedish dance music star Alesso (‘Leave A Little Love’), EDM juggernaut Steve Aoki (‘Music Means Love Forever’) and Dutch vocal sensation Davina Michelle (‘Hold On’), but also released the first volume of his new ‘A State Of Trance FOREVER’ album series, which features collaborations with some of the biggest artists in Trance and Progressive.\n\nTHE LABEL OWNER\n\nIn 2003, plans emerged to set up a record label. Together with Maykel Piron and David Lewis (Ar-Ma-Da), Armin found-ed Armada Music. Today, Armada Music is the biggest independent dance music label in the world, based in Amster-dam (HQ), London and New York (satellite offices).\n\nArmada Music represents labels and artists across the electronic music spectrum, releasing music from the likes of including Andrew Rayel, Armin van Buuren, ARTY, Erick Morillo, Ferry Corsten, Kevin Saunderson, Lost Frequencies, Loud Luxury, Morgan Page and W&W. Armin’s own ‘Armind’, ‘A State of Trance’, and ‘Who’s Afraid Of 138?!’ labels also operate under the wing of Armada Music, and the labels take a leading role in releasing Armin’s artist albums and ‘A State of Trance’ mix albums. Armada Music was voted #7 in Mixmag’s “Label Of The Decade” poll in 2017. One year later, in 2018, the label won the International Dance Music Award for ‘Best Global Label’ for the sixth time.\n\nDespite his ambitious and hectic schedule, Armin still serves as A&R manager for his own Armind, Who’s Afraid Of 138?!, and A State of Trance labels.\n\nTHE AMBASSADOR\n\nOn December 16, 2019, Armin van Buuren joined forces with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) to motivate mil-lions of people to join the movement and fight against plastic pollution. As a Global Oceans Ambassador, Armin will contribute to the worldwide #BeatPlastic campaign.",

His sets and productions brim with Acid House and Raw Electronic Groove, blended together with a mesmerizing uplifting fluidity that belies his age.\n\nChampioned by Jamie Jones, Marco Carola, The Martinez Brothers, Eats Everything, Patrick Topping, and even gaining support from global superstar Calvin Harris, Sterling has already featured on Hot Creations twice, Edible, Hottrax and Origins Rcrds – and was one of the first residents hand-picked by Josh Butler himself. At just 18, his residency at London’s Ministry of Sound marked him out as one to watch. It wasn’t long before he began to come through on the early promise. His Origins release ‘Ciao’, a record that soon caught the ears of Hot Creations and Paradise boss Jamie Jones.\n\nThe UK legend dropped seven of Sterling’s unreleased productions during a single EDC Las Vegas set, showing the same level of support at shows across Paradise, Coachella, Circoloco, Timewarp, Burning Man and many more, to later sign two consecutive EP’s to Hot Creations that same year. Now an established name in the house and techno scene, Ben has performed at a number of iconic clubs and festivals around the world, including DC-10, Resistance, HYTE, Paradise, elrow, Straf\\_Werk, The Warehouse Project, The BPM Festival and many more. On the road Ben has also shared the stage with many greats such as Jamie Jones, Marco Carola, Joseph Capriati, Nina Kraviz, Solomun, Ben Klock, Apollonia, Patrick Topping and Enzo Siragusa, to name a few.\n\nWith his eye now firmly on the rest of 2019 - which he kicked off in style as Danny Howard’s first “Future Fire” guest of the year on BBC Radio 1 - Sterling looks certain to continue on his trajectory towards the upper echoelons of dance music.",

      "name": "Chase & Status",
      "bio": "Talk about high expectations. When London drum’n'bass duo, Chase & Status aka Saul Milton (Chase) and Will Kennard (Status) first laid down the tracks that would make up their third studio album, they were faced with a weighty dilemma: how to follow the sizeable footprint left by 2011’s multi platinum selling No More Idols, not to mention their hefty rep as festival headliners? The answer was found with Brand New Machine, an album that brims with surging, dancefloor anthems, dusty trip hop grooves as championed by the likes of Massive Attack and Portishead, and a collection of jungle and garage breakbeats that increase with substance over repeated plays. Meanwhile, brooding ragga harmonies and hip hop samples deliver an updated take on No More Idols’ anthemic, catch-all appeal. The overall vibe? An instantly memorable collection of swaggering cuts tuned to a club setting, hyped summer festivals and arenas alike. “This album was more about getting down what we were feeling, what we were into and what sounded good. No More Idols greatly exceeded our expectations, which was an incredible feeling and something we hadn’t planned. It was a real buzz.” “This time around I guess we found the inspiration for what we wanted the album to sound like in our own record collections and experiences. We were born in the ‘80s, we grew up in the ‘90s, we went raving, we went to rock gigs. That scene, that vibe, that culture; the rude boy clothes, the end-of-the-weekend club scene going to see Jumpin’ Jack Frost it all seeped into the recording. The Prodigy, Massive Attack, the east coast and west coast rap sound…those things pushed us to get the tunes down. That was the inspiration for the record. We didn’t want to follow the crowd, we wanted to do what sounded good to us.” Meanwhile, their studio quickly became a revolving door for the dance scene’s emerging singing talent. A role call of sensations-in-waiting were invited to lay down vocals on a string of tracks, and appearances by studio debutants, Louis M^ttrs, rapper Knytro and the smoky tones of Brighton singer, Elli Ingram followed on from Chase & Status’s previous work with A-listers, Plan B, Tinie Tempah, indie doom-mongers White Lies and greats such as Cee‐Lo Green and Rihanna. “We used so many great singers in the recording process,” says Milton. “As with all our records, we liked working with interesting people like Nile Rodgers, and Pusha T, plus some newer, rawer names like Moko. But it was more exciting for the newer guys, they had passion and desire; that feeling of want. We’ve worked with artists who have gone on to do huge things after working with us… but they change! They aren’t the same in the studio anymore (once they make it big). They don’t have that same explosive desire that they had before. I love the eager vibe.” An album’s worth of tracks were recorded. As the spring of 2013 became summer, Chase & Status made a series of appearances on the festival circuit, road-testing new material along the way. First up was Radio 1’s Big Weekend Festival. “We performed (first single) Lost And Not Found with Louis M^ttrs who’s just the loveliest kid in the world. We asked him to come on the road with us; we threw him in the deep end massively because it was his first gig. I remember saying to him before he stepped out in front of 30,000 people, ‘Have you ever sung in front of anyone before?’ And he said, ‘Nah, just my dad and my uncle…’ Then he walked out to a huge crowd. But he smashed it and took it in his stride.” Next came their prestigious headline slot at Glastonbury, opposite The Rolling Stones, on the Other Stage, where Heaven Knows was premiered with Elli Ingram. “The way she moved onstage was so cool,” says Kennard. “Seeing her sing in front of that crowd was amazing, she has a cool sound already, and she has an incredible presence on stage. Elli’s a real talent.” Next followed a string of headline performances around the UK and Europe including T In The Park, Lowlands Festival and closing the main stage at Roskilde after Metallica. To round up another phenomenal summer on the festival circuit the band performed their storming, riotous show at Reading and Leeds Festival, on the Main Stage before Eminem. It was such a wild show that they had to stop the music multiple times to get the crowd to take a step back, reducing the crush at the front. Melvin Benn, the owner of Reading and Leeds, went on to say they were definite one day headliners. With the songwriting process completed, what followed was a period of soul searching as the duo took to polishing 14 tracks into an album that lived up to their high expectations. “We’re perfectionists,” says Milton. “It’s a gift and a curse at the same time. There’s a standard we won’t go below, which is great. But it also sends us around the bend because we go around the houses before we’re satisfied. We’ll write a track and then make 20 versions of it. All of them are very different.” “It drives us mad. Then after making 20 versions we usually realize that the first version was the best. It’s just about being tough on ourselves; we have high expectations of what we do. That’s when it becomes a job and we tend to go right to the wire until somebody tears the album from us so they can release it. Hopefully the results of that process make it worthwhile.” The hard work and perfectionism paid off when Brand New Machine stormed the UK charts at #2 and is currently quickly approaching Platinum status, not to mention closing the year with their first UK arena tour seeing the live band perform to over 80,000 people, which culminated in a phenomenal sold out homecoming show at London’s 02 Arena. It’s not as if Chase & Status are without history in the production process, however. For the best part of 10 years, Milton and Kennard have continually pushed drum’n'bass’s experimental spirit into increasingly brave, unchartered areas - rock, reggae, hip hop and soulful club grooves are just some of the genres that have been underpinned by their love for clattering breakbeats. Remixing for the likes of Jay Z and The Prodigy, Milton and Kennard have had six tracks feature on three of Rihanna’s smash hit albums as well as Snoop Dogg requesting to write on their early hit ‘Eastern Jam’ transforming it into ‘Snoop Dogg Millionaire’. With Brand New Machine’s kaleidoscopic sound, they’ve rebooted their reputation as the one of most exciting production teams on the scene. “I guess that’s happened because we have good foundations,” says Kennard. “When times are hard in this studio and we think, ‘This is all rubbish’, I always remember what we used to do when we first started. Like driving up the M1 to do a gig in Manchester and then driving back to Leeds for 6am - in a battered Peugeot 206 ‐ to do an early morning show for a couple of hundred quid. We remember what we loved about doing this in the first place ‐ the music.” 2014 saw Chase & Status complete another huge summer of touring the festival circuit with their live show, taking in slots at Global Gathering, Benicassim and an explosive headline slot in their hometown at London’s Lovebox Festival. Alongside these festival commitments, they were also the first bass music act to be given a weekly residency at Amnesia, one of Ibiza’s biggest and best-known clubs. At the end of 2014, Chase & Status and Rage teamed up with David Rodigan and Shy FX to form Rebel Sound, a dub dream team initially brought together to compete in the Red Bull Culture Clash at Earl’s Court. Rebel Sound took on 3 other crews - London grime collective, BBK; Reggae legends, Stone Love; and New York’s A$AP Mob and in front of a 20,000 strong crowd, won the title of Culture Clash champions for 2014. 2015 sees the duo head back to the studio to work on new material together while they continue to tour worldwide.",

      "bio": "Cole Knight has just played her first Coachella—a sure-fire marker that she’s an artist on the rise. Having recently made her mark playing shows around LA as well as in Tulum, where shesaw out the pandemic. Cole Knight has been on a journey of self-discovery, and she’s findingherself on the dance floor.\n\nKnight grew up in a small rural town about three hours south of Chicago, in a household where music almost never played. Despite this, she was drawn to music anyway, clamouring to use iTunes whenever she could and making mix CDs for her friends. Besides a brief stint learning piano and a longer, more dedicated stint learning guitar, Knight’s exposure to music up untilleaving high school was minimal.\n\nAfter school, Knight studied computer sciences at Michigan State University, where she ran cross country and track for the college team. In her junior year Knight decided to put her studies on hold to travel around Europe on modelling assignments, taking time to dive into the culture and music in cities like London, Milan and Paris. During this time, Knight downloadedRekordbox and started experimenting with DJing whenever she had free time.\n\nWhen Knight returned to school to finish her studies, she began picking up DJ gigs in the bars around campus. Upon graduating she set her sights on Los Angeles. After initially feeling intimidated by the scene there, she slowly made more connections by sending her mixes out to promoters, and gradually started picking up gigs at warehouse parties, after hours events and even soundtracking yoga classes.\n\nIn the time since, Knight has been honing her craft and defining her sound—deep, grooving house, hypnotic rhythms, atmospheric synths, trippy textures and the occasional catchy vocal or classic dance tune thrown in. To date she has shared a bill with the likes of Diplo and DJ Tennisin Las Vegas, Damian Lazurus and Swedish House Mafia at a Coachella after party and warming up for Black Coffee at Zamna in Tulum.\n\nAs Knight looks forward into the rest of 2022 and beyond, she’s allowing her intricate understanding of sound and her experience behind the decks to inform her first foray into production. “I want to put my flavour into the world,” she says. “It’s going to be a reflection of me, the places I travel to and the experiences I have with the people I meet. It’s going to be groovy, that’s for sure.”",

      "bio": "Gigolo means Playboy, but the word originally derives from the ancient French \"Gigole\" which used to mean Dancing Woman. This makes DJ Gigola both, a dancing woman and a playboy. Where others see tension and contradiction, DJ Gigola sees a chance for creation. In her playful way of breaking down boundaries, she hits the Zeitgeist of a generation that continuously transforms and recontextualises seemingly fixed concepts and stereotypes. As a result, both her sets and productions are quint-essentially genre-fluid. Her critically acclaimed cutting edge releases take a hybrid approach, successfully blending boundaries between Dance and Pop music. On a night out, you might hear DJ Gigola mix Madonna out of an old Bonzai record and back into Surgeon all within 5 minutes. Her sets are enigmatic and reflect a natural sense of curiosity - eager to explore, she does not shy away from experimenting. As playful as DJ Gigola’s selection may seem, however, she rigorously weaves together seemingly disperse tracks with one common thread: rhythm. She experiences music primarily through the rhythmic structure emergent from patterns of percussion rather than layers of melodic harmonies. This deep understanding for rhythm and groove, combined with her multi-facetted knowledge of music and curious audacity to try new things makes DJ Gigola one of the most exciting DJs to experience on a dance floor.",

      "bio": "For over a decade, Los Angeles-born and bred producer Deorro, or Erick Orrosquieta by name, has transcended musical styles, international borders, and broken cultural barriers with his genre-defying expertise. Armed with the same songwriting mastery and musical fluidity of his formative years as a bedroom producer and local hero, Deorro is now a globally-certified, chart-topping, platinum-selling artist.\n\nThe world was introduced to Deorro’s signature style in 2013 via “Yee” – his first major label release signed to Hardwell’s Revealed Recordings. A foreshadowing of greatness, “Yee” charted worldwide across Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, The Netherlands, and Switzerland. Deorro crossed over into the mainstream landscape in April 2014 with his groundbreaking single “Five Hours.” A quantum leap in his career, the track was a testament to his formidable sound design and dedication to sonic excellence. Equipped with warping crescendos, futuristic beats, and cerebral soundscapes, “Five Hours” went on to become a worldwide success charting in multiple countries including a #8 spot on SNEP official French Singles Chart and peaked at #1 on Billboard’s Dance Airplay chart. Like a detonated grenade, “Five Hours” initiated a seismic wave of non-stop momentum leading to a series of accolades including a guest cameo on MTV’s Teen Wolf and a commendable ranking in DJ Mag's Celebrated Top 100 DJs annual poll at #19 – the highest new entry of 2014. That same year, Deorro released his spanish hit “Perdoname” featuring DyCy and Adrian Delgado which garnered over 53 million plays across streaming platforms, won Best Latin American DJ at the EMPO Awards and now stands as a 2x Platinum record.\n\nBreaking into spaces outside of dance music, In 2015, Deorro teamed up with Grammy Award-winning R&B icon Chris Brown for their critically acclaimed track “Five More Hours.” The collaborative hit accelerated Deorro’s career to an unprecedented upward trajectory with the chart-topping track receiving more than 19 global certifications, 330 million Spotify streams, and over 200 million YouTube views and counting. A proud Mexican-American and voice for the Latin music community, his Latin/EDM hybrid single “Bailar” is now an 8x Platinum-certified hit that went on to win Latin Billboard’s Tropical Song of The Year along with a subsequent recording with esteemed musical legend and performer Pitbull.\n\nAn amalgamation of years of success and collaborative excellence, Deorro’s 2017 debut album Good Evening brought together the sounds, styles, and influences that levitated him to fame. Signed to Ultra Music, Good Evening is a versatile venture into sound-design. A conceptual LP with a staggering 24 tracks, the project is equipped with intros, outros, interludes, and story-telling. A narrative outline of the many subgenres that make-up the spectrum of dance music, Good Evening captures the wonders of future bass, dubstep, jazz-swing, and more. The album stacked a laundry list of accolades ranking high in the Apple Music Dance Album charts around the world, including #1 in two countries, #4 in France, #19 in Australia, and reached the Top 50 in Apple Music’s overall chart across six countries. With releases spanning major labels like Interscope, Spinnin’ Records, Mad Decent, and more, sync deals with 22 Jump Street, Zac Efron’s We Are Your Friends, and MTV’s Teen Wolf, additional collaborations with Steve Aoki and Diplo, and appearances at globally-esteemed festivals like Tomorrowland, Coachella, Lollapalooza, Parrokavile and World Club Dome in Germany and performances at venues like Shrine Auditorium, an ongoing residency at Marquee Nightclub Las Vegas and appearances across Ibiza, Deorro has become a decorated asset to the global dance music community.\n\nEmbracing the heart of his roots, 2022 was another groundbreaking year for Deorro courtesy of his well-received debut Latin LP ORRO. The engaging 19-track album, written entirely in Spanish, bridges the gap between mainstage electronic music and Latin dance music while simultaneously expanding on and innovating his signature style. The Billboard-praised album was followed by his 60-date worldwide Tour De ORRO tour including a string of Los Angeles shows which sold 8500 tickets in just one weekend. If partnering with the Men's Mexican National Soccer team for an 8-date concert series leading to the World Cup wasn’t enough, Deorro also took his live performance to the NFL to dominate a Thursday night half-time show for the Los Angeles Rams. A sought-after collaborator, Deorro performed as direct support for Bad Bunny on his World's Hottest tour, partnered with Tiesto to release “Savage” which garnered 33 million streams in 8 months, and fashioned an official remix for Pitbull’s “Discoteca” which he performed live at Premio Lo Nuestro where he was nominated for DJ Del Año – DJ of The Year.\n\nWith a fearless dedication to crafting intercultural hits and dissolving the boundaries of geography with music, Deorro has already released his 4-track EP Reflect in January of 2023 and will continue transforming the Latin-dance landscape for years to come.",

      "bio": "Robert Etheridge aka Dimension is one of the UK’s most unique electronic music artists. Defined by a clear aesthetic that bleeds through into his music and imagery, Dimension has announced himself as one of the new wave of dance music headliners.\n\nDimension’s combination of seemingly effortless musicality and production prowess first caught the attention of tastemakers and DJs such as Chase & Status, Annie Mac (5x Hottest Records), Skrillex (who remixed the much-lauded ‘UK’), and deadmau5. Over the past few years, he’s built a discography balanced between airwave conquering vocals and underground club anthems; and what was once one of UK dance music’s best kept secret now has a rapidly growing global profile.\n\nReleased on 19 June, ‘Saviour’, is Dimension’s most powerful record to date and the first track from his forthcoming debut artist album. A glimpse into Dimension’s ambitious vision, ‘Saviour’, was co-written with Jem Cooke (Camelphat ‘Breathe’) and features Sharlene Hector (Duke Dumont ‘Therapy’ / Solardo ‘XTC’). The track will precede a run of further singles towards the as yet untitled album release later in 2020.\n\nAfter a remarkable rise since his debut single, Dimension announced himself on the global stage with ‘Desire’, his collaboration with Sub Focus. The record’s list of achievements is near endless; it spent 9 weeks on Radio 1’s playlist (5 on the A-list), has amassed over 50 million global streams to date and has been certified a silver single in the UK by BPI (200,000 sales). Following ‘Desire’ came Dimension’s next string of solo releases, ‘Devotion’ featuring Cameron Hayes, ‘If You Want To’ and ‘Love To Give’ which all rapidly picked up midweek Annie Mac support alongside BBC Radio 1 plays from Phil Taggart’s Hype Chart, Mistajam and Rene LaVice; and together, hitting over 20 million global streams to date.\n\n‘Desire’ was Dimension’s fifth Hottest Record courtesy of Annie Mac on BBC Radio 1, who has been a long time supporter alongside Pete Tong and Danny Howard. Further Hottest Records include his standout collaboration with Wilkinson ‘Rush’ and club anthem ‘UK’. In 2019 he performed at Radio 1’s Big Weekend in Middlesbrough, which was followed by his debut Essential Mix, which was met with critical acclaim. Alongside his original productions, Dimension is also a selective remixer, having reworked the likes of deadmau5, Chase & Status, Nero and Duke Dumont.\n\nIn tandem with his release schedule, Dimension has balanced a hectic global touring schedule that’s included sold out tours across the UK, Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. This is coupled with performances at some of the world’s most acclaimed festivals, including Glastonbury, Reading & Leeds, Tomorrowland, EDC Las Vegas, Pukkelpop and many others, as well as a long-standing residency at Amnesia in Ibiza.\n\nDIMENSION LIVE, his sold out debut live show at London’s prestigious Electric Brixton in October, attracted critical acclaim from Mixmag, RA, DJ Mag, Red Bull, and beyond. The first immersive, multi-sensory experience in dance music, the show debuted Dimension’s showpiece glass mechanical structure - the centrepiece of a production that included a 50-piece state-of-the-art lighting system, laser walls, the largest ever LED screen to be installed in the venue, pyrotechnics and for the first time in a live music environment, scentology. Conceived by Dimension, the show was created in conjunction with INPLAS - a film set and fabrication company whose clients include George Lucas (Star Wars), Ridley Scott (Prometheus), HBO (Game of Thrones), Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Inception), Alex Turner of GravityRigs (The Chemical Brothers and Disclosure live), Liam Mace of DarkMatter, and More Eyes (Stormzy).\n\nFurther shows will be announced in due course, which will include a headline LIVE show at the groundbreaking Printworks London.",

      "name": "Dknow (MC Dino)",
      "bio": "Colorado junglists know him as MC Dino, the infamous 8-year resident of Breakdown Thursdays at the Snake Pit, the nation's #1 Drum and Bass club night. The rock star emcee most notorious for his poetic genius with a microphone has commanded crowds at such well known and respected events as Cyberfest, Bassrush, Electric Daisy Carnival and countless other raves and festivals across the United States. Recognized for his high-energy lyrical prowess on the microphone, MC Dino is a crowd favorite on the mic and is an asset to any DJ he rhymes alongside.\n\nAlthough Dino is not his given name, it is his preference and insists that the other is irrelevant. Though born in a small farming community in Northern Colorado, Dino spent time growing up in Mexico and various parts of California before returning to Colorado well over a decade ago. In high school he spent more time writing lyrics, songs, and practicing with bands in backyards than on his schoolwork. He began going to raves when he was 14, a time when raves were new and entirely underground. This exposure had great influence on him; electronic music provided a new medium and mode of tampering with instrumental sound. In this scene he also discovered jungle music and emceeing. Besides the obvious electronic movement that so dramatically shaped his personal musical efforts, Dino's other prominent influences include Prince, Roni Size and Santana. Exposure to these along with an upbringing encouraging all music is especially evident in his individual work, emceeing, and collaborations with Urban Aboriginee.\n\nIn 1997 he set out as an emcee and, inspired by the aggressive new sound jungle provided, used it as an outlet for the poetry streaming through his head. By this time he had already taught himself to dj and moved between rhyming and spinning, while continuing to write his own music. 1998 proved a year of reckoning and direction. He started performing regularly at the Snake Pit on a night then called Plastic Thursdays that offered techno one half of the night and jungle the other. During this period Dino gathered his musically-inclined cohorts and formed a solid group called Urban Aboriginee. The idea behind Urban Aboriginee was to promote the various but sometimes neglected talents (emceeing, DJing, producing, etc) of his intimate circle. The name alludes to modern day tribesmen surviving the streets of a concrete jungle (the city). Urban Aboriginee was recognized throughout Denver for its dedication to Jungle music. For five years, UA sponsored Kombat Battle, a party that allows young deejays and MC's to showcase their talent and provided an opportunity for up-and-comers to perform live in an actual party atmosphere. \n\nIn 2004 Dino was introduced to Divine Elements through the drum n bass scene when he moved to Los Angeles. Fast forward 6 years of non stop MCing for some of the biggest names in the business and the biggest festivals and night clubs across the United States and we find Dino falling into the front man position with D.E. He ended up filling the void Divine Elements had long been waiting to fulfill with a front man MC. Dino was a fluid fit in the dynamic super group. He now is a consistent, positive force in an already solid musical group, touring and writing music with them all the time . \n\nDuring the for mentioned 6 year fast forward between 2004 and 2010, MC Dino has emceed for the greatest names in Drum and Bass, and Dubstep including Andy C, Shimon, Pendulum, Nero, Skrillex, Diesel Boy, AK1200, Dara, Bad Company, Mampi Swift, Teach Itch, and Craze, to name a few. Of course, he performs weekly and nationally as well as being featured on tracks produced by the likes of DJ Icee, Gridlok, Breakdown, Reidspeed, Divine Elements, and DJ Swamp. Other such accomplishments include co-creating Urban Aboriginee Records with his Partner Casey Bonse. Current works include on going production and live performance with Divine Elements, solo projects and audio engineering for various artists in the music community.",

In 2023 he is slated to return to Coachella and continues to broadcast his passion project, Process Radio, which won him an Electronic Dance Music Award for best radio show.

      "name": "Eric Prydz",
      "bio": "For over ten years, Eric Prydz has been synonymous with immaculately produced and unique sounding electronic music. The Platinum-selling producer is responsible for some of the biggest progressive house tracks of the last decade, not to mention some of the most technically impressive live shows of any touring artist.\n\nAs a solo artist, Prydz has headlined some of the world’s most storied venues, from Madison Square Garden to Brixton Academy and Alexandra Palace, earned multiple Grammy nominations, hosted an ongoing radio show for Beats1 and topped charts with his alter-egos Pryda and Cirez D. Despite the headline-grabbing shows and releases, Prydz remains reclusive. It’s his dedication to his craft as a producer and DJ that leaves him in the highly enviable and singular position of appealing to dance music’s underground connoisseurs and main-stage masses alike.\n\nThis appeal is most evident in Prydz’s debut album, OPUS. Its title track graced festival main stages and blacked-out warehouses alike, and its spine-tingling, slow-burn beauty made a fan out of Four Tet, who ended up remixing it for himself. A project ten years in the making, the two-disc, 19-track album balances pop and prog house, and euphoria and melancholy, in a career-spanning capsule that, according to Pitchfork, “confirms him as both a master craftsman and a masterful manipulator of emotions.” OPUS was named one of the best dance albums of the year by Rolling Stone, Billboard, SPIN and more.\n\nPrydz began building his craft in Stockholm, Sweden, where he played extended intimate club gigs while constructing his artistic identity. Here, Prydz refined his signature sound, blending together influences as varied as Depeche Mode, Parliament, and Swedish techno legend Cari Lekebusch. It’s little wonder, then, that Prydz has refused to constrain himself to one sound, and indeed is behind two of electronic music’s most celebrated monikers, Pryda and Cirez D.\n\nPryda is Prydz’s most well-known alias, one whose sound is replicated endlessly in dance music. Listen to the discographies of any current electronic music success and you can hear Pryda’s influence -- the ‘Pryda Sound,’ comprised of immaculately layered melodies and harmonies, is now almost a sub-genre unto itself. Pryda’s origins can be traced back to 2004, with the releases of “Aftermath” (2005), “Muranyi” (2007) and “Pjanoo” (2008) solidifying the Pryda name within the new breed of progressive house. The 2012 release of the three-disc album, Eric Prydz Presents Pryda, offers a full retrospective of one of dance music’s most storied discographies.\n\nCirez D offers a stark contrast to the rich melodies of Pryda, its stripped-back techno dark, raw, and designed for ominous warehouses and long, late-night sets. It’s a deliberate point of focus for Prydz, who relishes playing those environments, and Cirez D, like his other monikers, offers him the freedom to make and release the records that he wants to play, unconstrained by expectations.\n\nPrydz’s productions are only one half of the story. As a DJ, he’s been celebrated as one of the most consistent live performers around. It’s not only his abilities that set him apart, but the vision behind his performances. In 2011, Prydz debuted EPIC (Eric Prydz In Concert) at London’s Brixton Academy. At its core, EPIC offered a way to visually experience Eric’s music, its pioneering use of holograms and sheer ambition of scale wowing the industry. EPIC’s subsequent iterations have only grown from there: EPIC 2.0 made its way stateside, EPIC 3.0 filled up New York’s iconic Madison Square Garden, while the sold-out EPIC 4.0 tour, earned praise from Resident Advisor for his ability to “create a common ground between a techno fan and a candy raver.” In May 2017, Prydz performed EPIC 5.0 in London, his biggest show to date. Selling 15,000 tickets in under 4 hours was a major achievement for the EPIC series. Summer 2017 also saw Prydz host his debut Ibiza residency, filling Hï Ibiza for 10 weeks throughout the season. He also introduced another bespoke production which was designed and installed by his EPIC team, which proved to be a major success, and more importantly groundbreaking for Ibiza.\n\nResiding in Los Angeles, Eric Prydz continues to set himself apart in electronic music through his visceral productions and exhilarating live shows.",

      "bio": "If the protagonist of Daft Punks ‘Da Funk’ was walking around the streets of New York City today there’d be one thing playing on his boombox and it’d be three piece Fcukers. Whilst on his journey throughout the Lower East Side he’d probably end up running into members of the band working nightlife jobs as DJs, throwing parties in local bars and restaurants or simply finding the frequency of Manhattan’s beat and locking in.\n\nFronted by the energetic and enigmatic Shanny Wise (previously of The Shacks) and backed by producer/night life DJ Jackson Walker Lewis. Fcukers have discovered their own new frequency where a history of playing together and in other projects has led them to syncing on a singular vision built around 90s/00s house music, tasteful trip hop, big beat, indie rock and everything in between.\n\nHaving played only a handful of shows in their short existence Fcukers have managed to unite New York and now London’s night life scenes for exhilarating parties with sold out shows at Baby’s All Right, Drom, Sebright Arms and The Market Hotel… where music fans consisting of it girls and boys, skaters, models, culture seekers and more congregate to tap into the Fcukers frequency and dance the night away. Their recent performance at Market Hotel proving the hype is building around the three piece with the likes of Beck, Julian Casablancas, Clairo and Yves Tumor in attendance, joining the crowd of NYC’s coolest kids to catch an early glimpse of Fcukers.\n\nTheir debut tracks Mothers and Devils Cut are homages to parties gone before them but moreso to the maestros who such parties were built around such as Saint Etienne, Daft Punk, Chemical Brothers, Coldcut, Todd Terry and so many more. Early reception included NYC house legend Junior Sanchez DM’ing the band to remix both tracks… a perfect nod to the forbearers of house music who so carefully built their own frequencies, and ignited a flame for Fcukers to carry onto dancefloors across the globe. They’ve since been tapped on the shoulder by music legends Lol Tolhurst, Budgie, Jacknife and James Murphy to remix their track Los Angeles with the result being an instant dance floor classic reminiscent of DFA’s golden years.\n\nWith only two songs released and a handful of shows under their belt, Fcukers have already garnered plenty of attention from tastemaker artists such as Dom Dolla, Avalon Emerson and Jockstrap performing alongside them across the US. Fashion icon and cultural influencer Hedi Slimane of Celine jumped on Fcukers early, flying the group out to Paris Fashion Week to DJ their closing party. The attention didn’t stop there with the Vans team flying Fcukers out to perform at the House Of Vans and St. Jerome’s Laneway Festival Stages at SXSW Sydney in October. With a stopover to performing in Tokyo they would achieve the feat of having performed their first ten shows across four continents…unheard of in the modern era of music…maybe ever.\n\nEarly praise and radio spins have come from the likes of Apple Music’s Wilko along with BBC 1’s Jack Saunders and Ariel Free with the latter lauding “...really really new this band but getting lots of people very very excited…This one has a real vibe and beat to it, gonna get you dancing”.\n\nWith a handful of performances across the globe on the cards for Fcukers to close out 2023 they’ll be busy digging deeper into their crates as they work on new music to be released in 2024 with the stage set for the rest of the world to tune in.",

As a pro snowboarder in the early 1990s, Blakley was able to put his earnings to use as a rave promoter in Denver. Never one to be just a spectator, he bought his own set of turntables and submerged himself in the hardcore techno sound. As the genre evolved, it transformed into Jungle/Drum & Bass, and Blakley became known as Denver’s “King of Jungle.”\n\nAs Fury, Blakley has kept a rigorous travel itinerary, rinsing out high-profile venues from coast to coast. Despite this packed schedule, Blakley continued to expand Denver’s growing dance music community from the event production side as well. The hugely successful Rewind and Reload event series pulled in thousands of Drum & Bass enthusiasts from all over the world, and the weekly series Breakdown Thursdays and later, Gravity Fridays, both became some of the longest-running electronic music nights in the nation.\n\nToday, regular Reload events continue to elevate Denver’s bass music scene. In addition, Fury has remained a regular at many of the nation’s biggest festivals including EDC Las Vegas, Global Dance Festival, Bass Canyon, Forbidden Kingdom, and many more. As a Bassrush and Reload resident, you are sure to see him soon at an upcoming show.\n\nBlakley is also the founder of the internationally acclaimed design company, The Firm Graphics. The Firm was built from the ground up and has grown to become one of the most influential design companies, particularly in the EDM scene, catering currently and in the past to high-profile clients such as Insomniac, Illenium, Kaskade, V2 Presents, and countless others. If you’ve seen promotion for any large-scale festival-style electronic music event in the past 20 years, it’s a safe bet that Steve has had a hand in its design.

      "bio": "Having cemented herself as a true maven of the peak time banger via a series of high-energy features on the likes of Solardo’s Sola, Patrick Topping’s TRICK, Jax Jones Presents and Spinnin’ Records, a succession of sell-out club nights under her own outfit, plus upcoming shows at the likes of DC10 and Warehouse Project — it’s hard to look away from Dundee born-and-raised DJ and producer Hannah Laing’s unstoppable trajectory to the top. Rapturous new single ‘Climax’ on WUGD joins a slew of big room, blissed-out anthems spanning house, techno and everything in between — including her knockout 2019 bootleg of Sophie Ellis Bextor’s iconic 2001 hit ‘Murder On The Dancefloor’, a rework that earned Laing global acclaim and the notice of some of the biggest names in the business, including FISHER who dropped the track during most sets in 2019.\n\nHaving caught the attention of BBC Radio 1’s Pete Tong, Danny Howard, JAGUAR and Sarah Story, she made her BBC Introducing debut at BBC Radio 1’s Big Weekend in May 2022. She has still found time to develop her own podcast and club night: Hannah’s Choice — with guests such as Hannah Wants, Marc Kinchen, Jax Jones and Ben Helmsley. Hannah credits her prowess as a DJ to her time hustling as an Ibiza resident, having landed her first regular spot at a Scottish bar in San Antonio at the tender age of 19 — going on to play at island institutions DC-10, Amnesia and Hï. This daily grind as DJ — bringing in guests and keeping the energy high no matter how many bodies were on the dancefloor — has given her a keen ability to stretch and manoeuvre a room, ensuring every performance is unique and reactive.\n\nHaving been raised on a diet of Paul Oakenfold, Roger Sanchez and a treasure trove of Hedkandi cassette tapes — all from archives of her rave-loving parents, Laing doesn’t remember a time when she wasn’t surrounded by dance music. Her first encounter with the club was at age 15, an experience that fundamentally affected Laing’s musical outlook; she recalls watching on eagerly as Dave Pearce dropped trance classics such as Delirium’s ‘Silence’. From that day on, Hannah had caught the bug, gaining her first ever DJ gig at 18 at a tiny pub in Arbroath attended by a coach load of her friends and family — from here, she took every opportunity to show off her skills with both hands: weddings, baby showers, birthdays… you name it. Her move from mixing to making music came about through a mixture of opportunity and dedication, first by chance having heard about a fellow Ibiza worker who was giving lessons to budding producers on Ableton — becoming so engrossed in her tuition, she dedicated every day off she had on the island to learn the new skill. Once back in Scotland, she signed up for a course at Escapade Studios and also works with longtime friend Erskine Audio — transitioning from looping basics to full-blown breakdown ecstasy, all with a dancefloor destination in mind.\n\nComing up this year, Hannah Laing has a massive club and festival calendar ahead. Heading back to the White Isle, she’ll be joining Patrick Topping’s TRICK party at DC10 as well as TRICK’s Glasgow instalment at 100 Eastvale — alongside festivals Creamfields, Beatherder and TRNSMT. With features on Data Transmissions Spotlight Mix Series, a peak time mix on Sarah Story’s Future Dance on BBC Radio 1 and many more, expect to hear much more about this rising star this summer.",

In his singular path as an artist, I Hate Models swerves standardised structures and instead focuses on emotional response. The energy of club music serves as a vessel for his own feelings and a tool to manipulate others with. The spectrum of moods expressed – in his productions, DJ sets and on his label Disco Inferno – veers from nostalgia and passion to loneliness, melancholia and brutality, often juxtaposing darkness and light in the same pulse as an authentic conduit of his own artistic self-assessment. On his journey thus far, IHM has released music on labels ranging from Arts to Perc Trax, who carried his 2019 album L’Âge Des Métamorphoses. He’s also remixed Depeche Mode. At every turn, his disregard for expectations and conventions has resulted in dynamic, ambitious music that feasts on the flesh of techno, industrial and trance without ever becoming beholden to one source. Within the microcosm of one track, the energy can shift from bruising rhythm to swooning ambience and back again – cascades of pearlescent melody giving way to shards of sheet metal, thunderous percussion offset by softly sculpted sine waves. That the further adventures of I Hate Models feel entirely open-ended is completely by design – generic constriction is the enemy of genuine catharsis.",

      "name": "INZO",
      "bio": "For INZO, there's a thrill in possibility. The Denver-based electronic artist is less concerned with labels and more with creating immaculate vibes and moving melodies. \"If I could make any and every genre,\" he says, \"I would.\" He lives up to that mission through luminescent synth lines that flutter through his tracks like fireflies, chest-caving bass, and wistful, nostalgic vocal samples. Through it all, no matter what sounds and styles he chooses, he has a constant goal: He wants you to feel something. \"If you're crying, if you're having a fun time, if you're having an epiphany at that moment,\" INZO says, \"sad, happy, whatever — I just want my music to be an experience.\"\n\nHaving last released music in 2020, INZO is currently working on bringing his new and varied experiences to life. In addition to a collaborative EP with fellow dance experimenter LSDREAM, he's preparing his solo EP, Earth Magic. Created during lockdown, its tracks are more cinematic and calmer, with lo-fi beats, piano breakdowns, and transcendent synth beams — a byproduct of his renewed focus on health and wellness. Making music itself has become therapeutic for INZO, so it's fitting that his new work reflects that cozy headspace. As much as he enjoys playing live, he especially loves the quieter, more intimate moments of listening back to a track he's made for the first time and realizing it's exactly what he'd envisioned. \"I like to make music for other people to enjoy,\" he says, \"but at the end of the day it's an expression of me.\"\n\nGrowing up in Chicago, INZO, born Mike Inzano, seemed destined for music. When he was 4 years old, his parents enrolled him in piano lessons where he studied classical greats like Beethoven; at 6, he chose to learn drums inspired by rock groups like Red Hot Chili Peppers. In high school, Inzano found increasing success as part of a metal band. When a potentially career-making opportunity to play Warped Tour fell through, he took it as a sign to move on, go to college, and pursue a medical career. But freshman year, he found rave culture, which pulled him back in. Instead of attending classes, Inzano camped out in the campus music studio and taught himself production, eventually leaving school behind to pursue it full-time.\n\nFor the next two years, INZO tried on different styles, hopping from soaring progressive house (\"High Above\") and raucous electro house (\"Brocaine Camaro\") to a pop-rock-electronic hybrid (\"Young Heart\"). In 2017, he released the single \"Visionaries,\" a hazy track with crashing waves of bass and warm, cascading synth drops. Somewhere in its mellow ambiance and ethereal arrangements, something clicked. \"That was the first time I was sure of my musical identity,\" he recalls. \"Who I wanted to be, the music I wanted to make, the sound I wanted to capture.\"\n\nFollowing that instinct served INZO well. His next single, 2018's introspective \"Overthinker,\" was his most successful to date, recently surpassing 52 million Spotify streams. The bass-heavy track builds on atmosphere, sampling a speech by philosopher Alan Watts that cuts through the dreamy melodies and euphoric synth blooms with sobering musings. Then, inspired to shake up his sound, INZO flexed his range on his 2019 debut EP, Multiverse, delivering stuttering funk on \"Let It Slide,\" laser-charged heaviness on \"Y,\" and blindingly bright melodies on the title track.\n\nAs INZO prepares new music, he's still keen on keeping people guessing. The tracks he's making now are more vivid, softer, and prettier, but he hints at troves of unreleased tracks approaching heavier and more experimental territory — and even more surprise collaborations. What will he put out next? With INZO, anything is possible as long as it's an experience.\n\nDuring a summer full of pivotal performances in 2023 at festivals such as North Coast, Wakaan, Bass Canyon and Sonic Bloom or a coveted headlining night at Mishawaka Amphitheatre, INZO played alongside GRiZ and B2B with LSDREAM, among others while heavy-hitters such as REZZ and Liquid Stranger were airing his tracks out to their crowds.\n\nLeft inspired by the visionaries in the world, INZO started his Visionquest heading into 2024 to pursue his vision of what music can be which all starts where he did as an early producer, in the house music realm with his EP \"Sidequest,\" via Lowly. INZO shares, \"No, I am not \"changing genres\" or am only making house music. This is a \"sidequest\" by name.. sidequest by nature. I just wanted to do a project that felt fun and not too introspective.\"\n\nThe lead single off \"Sidequest,\" \"Bass In Yo Face,\" opens eyes with bass music elements then cracks the dance floor alive with a silky house drop. \"Dopamine\" with LSDREAM orchestrates a sonic conversation with rave energy and unfathomable rhythms, immersing listeners in his signature atmospheric enclave. Then the nonstop funky tech house tune \"Funky Fusion'' defines fun. INZO will have plenty more sounds to explore and unveil along his upcoming Visionquest tour.",

      "name": "Kaskade",
      "bio": "Grammy-nominated electronic producer Kaskade emerged as one of the most successful American progressive house DJs of the 2000s, pioneering the concept of Las Vegas residencies and selling out arenas across America. With his bright, uplifting dance anthems, he was a steady presence on the U.S. dance charts into the 2010s with Top Ten releases that included chart-toppers Fire & Ice (2011) and Atmosphere (2013). One year later, I Remember (2014) compiled the best of his Ultra years, after which he renewed his contract with the label and released Automatic (2015). During the late 2010s, Raddon began rounding up his singles work into a series of EPs titled Redux.\n\nBorn Ryan Gary Raddon in Chicago, he spent his early days not only as a DJ, but also as an A&R director and record store owner. In the late '90s, he familiarized himself with the rapidly changing electronic music scene, eventually finding that house music was the subgenre he loved best. He DJ'ed in both New York and Salt Lake City, where he would first produce tracks released on his own tiny label, Mechanized Records. He also sold his music to John Elkins, A&R director for OM Records, who later hired Raddon to assist him at the label. By night, Kaskade spun at local clubs and by day helped kick-start the careers of many artists, including Ming + FS and soul-house act Soulstice.\n\nHis own full-length recordings under the Kaskade moniker began with 2003's house-inflected It's You, It's Me. A soulful, more organic direction provided focus for the following year's In the Moment, and Raddon kept his name in the record racks by piloting editions in the San Francisco Sessions DJ series (as well as the label mix House of OM). He proved surprisingly dedicated to his production craft, releasing Love Mysterious in 2006, which placed on Billboard's electronic albums chart. That same year, he parted ways with OM and signed with Ultra.\n\nArriving in 2008, Strobelight Seduction -- featuring production by Deadmau5 -- became his biggest commercial success to date, buoyed by the lead single \"Move for Me.\" Released in 2010, Dynasty celebrated his new reputation with a parade of vocal features and a co-production with Tiësto. It also became his first LP to chart on the Billboard 200. That year, Raddon put together Electric Daisy Carnival, a mix showcasing artists on the bill for the inaugural dance music festival of the same name.\n\nThe double-album Fire & Ice followed in 2011 and debuted in the Billboard Top 20. Featuring a production assist from Skrillex on \"Lick It,\" the effort also included guest vocals from Neon Trees and Skylar Grey. Atmosphere arrived two years later and featured softer, more relaxed music along with vocals from Kaskade himself. After the 2014 compilation I Remember rounded up the best material from his years on Ultra, the DJ renewed his contract with the label and one year later released Automatic. The album featured guest appearances from Estelle, Galantis, John Dahlbäck, and K. Flay, and peaked on the Billboard Electronic chart at number two. In 2016, Kaskade joined Deadmau5 and Skylar Grey on the single \"Beneath Me.\" The following year, he issued the Redux EP 002 (featuring LoKii, Mr. Tape, and Late Night Alumni), as well as the holiday-themed Kaskade Christmas. The DJ then joined Charlotte Lawrence for the 2018 single \"Cold as Stone.\" His third installment of the Redux series arrived in 2019. Redux EP 003 presented a seamless mix featuring Felix Cartal, Gorgon City, and more. ~ L. Katz & John Bush, Rovi",

      "bio": "LF SYSTEM's 'Afraid To Feel' is quickly becoming the sound of the summer. After spending three weeks in the UK Top 5, the track has now spent four weeks at #1 making it the first UK dance chart-topper since Joel Corry's 'Head & Heart' in 2020. It has already exceeded 30 million streams and has been certified Silver, while Gold status is well within reach.\n\nBlending modernist disco vibes, towering soul vocals playfully reworked from Silk's 1979 single 'I Can't Stop (Turning You On)' and classic piano house keys, 'Afraid To Feel' was generating steam long before its official release. It first took off with tastemaker support from Jamie Jones, LP Gioppi, Noizu and more, before becoming an airplay smash, which commenced when it was named as Clara Amfo's Hottest Record on Radio 1's Future Sounds. It has been a major airplay hit ever since, first being named as Radio 1's Tune of the Week and then enjoying an extended run on Radio 1's A-list, and becoming the most played track at Radio 1, Kiss FM and Capital. 'Afraid To Feel' subsequently translated to TikTok too with millions of video views.\n\nThe success of LF SYSTEM has played a significant part in the current resurgence of the Scottish music scene. 'Afraid To Feel' reached #1 on the same day that Paolo Nutini topped the album charts with 'Last Night in The Bittersweet' — a moment that Lewis Capaldi celebrated during his headline show at Glasgow's TRNSMT.\n\nLF SYSTEM commented, \"Just over two years ago we played our first show as LF SYSTEM, and just over two months ago we were still working our day jobs. And now we have the first UK #1 dance single since Joel Corry two years ago. No idea how we've gone from releasing disco edits on SoundCloud years to battling it out with Harry Styles, George Ezra, Beyoncé and Kate Bush. Thanks again to everybody who's shown support and love towards us and our music. We will never forget this.\"\n\nThe single's profile has again been boosted with remixes courtesy of Running Back founder Gerd Janson, CID and Tommy Villiers.\n\nConsisting of Conor Larkman and Sean Finnigan, LF SYSTEM met through playing B2B sets at the Edinburgh club night FLY. After sharing those initial disco edits on SoundCloud, they started dropping their own tracks on the platform too with five 'People Want Music' demo EPs. One of those tracks was their first single 'Dancing Cliché,' which picked up early club support from Ewan McVicar, Elliott Adamson, Danny Howard and TSHA. It later received a full commercial release through Warner Records and spent 6 weeks on the Radio 1 playlist.\n\nThe big moments kept on coming, with a sold-out show at Sneaky Pete's in Edinburgh and being named as The Blessed Madonna's One To Watch for 2022. They have also been sought out for official remixes for Fatboy Slim and Carl Cox ('Speed Trials On Acid') and Jodie Harsh ('No Sleep'). And now 'Afraid To Feel' is elevating them from their modest roots to international attention.\n\nLF SYSTEM recently performed at Radio 1's Big Weekend, played their first Boiler Room set at FLY Open Air and now have a big summer of shows ahead of them. Highlights include their first ever London headline show at Night Tales, an Amnesia show presented by Danny Howard, and a huge night at special guests at Gorgon City presents Realm in Liverpool.",

      "name": "Layton Giordani",
      "bio": "New York’s Layton Giordani stands firm as one of the planet’s most popular tastemakers from techno’s new school. His pioneering musical vision serves as a contemporary voice for the passionate younger generation of cutting edge electronic music fans.\n\nA studio obsessive with absolute dedication to his craft, Layton’s diverse repertoire of sounds today presents a new forward facing soundscape of hi energy techno and underground house aimed firmly at the peak time dance floor.\n\nInspired by the profound experience he had in his teens, of watching the masterful Danny Tenaglia rock Pacha NY all night long, Layton began to hone his own skills behind the decks, eventually landing a pivotal residency at Brooklyn’s iconic clubbing institution Output NY. It was here Layton’s abilities quickly sharpened and where he began to catch the eye of the A list guests playing the venue each week. It was thanks to the initial faith Output instilled in him that Layton then began making a name for himself far beyond America’s east coast.\n\nUnder the mentorship of Adam Beyer, Layton honed his talents further by closely studying the cardinal cuts from techno’s illustrious and rich history. The affiliation resulted in his first EP, Unspoken being signed to Beyer’s Truesoul label which was shortly followed by Rivington, Layton’s debut release on Drumcode, the label that would then become Layton’s home.\n\nIt was in 2017 that Layton Giordani erupted onto the global scene with his aptly-named debut artist album on Drumcode - Where It Begins. This 12-track LP served as the first seismic indication of his talent and capabilities and it subsequently received great critical acclaim from press, peers, fans and the wider industry. Months after the album’s release Layton found himself collaborating with Danny Tenaglia to create Live Again which many today still consider to be one of Drumcode’s contemporary classics.\n\nOne year later and the advancement of Layton’s career showed no signs of slowing as he joined forces with Adam Beyer and Chicago icon Green Velvet to create Space Date which subsequently assembled over 19 million streams on Spotify. This record became the anthem of the summer in 2018 and it marked another pivotal step up in tempo for Layton’s European touring schedule which now included main stage appearances at Drumcode Festival NL, Awakenings, Resistance Ibiza, Melt! Festival, Warehouse Project and many more.\n\n2019 saw more hits as stellar solo EP Phase II landed and after that Layton’s Drumcode hit Chrome. Fuzion - his collaboration with Green Velvet closed the year and went on to be one of the biggest releases for Relief Records.\n\nConsumed with creative aspiration and further seeking to express his unique perspective on the genre, 2020 saw the delivery of Layton’s most complete and robust offering to date, with his sophomore album New Generation. Crafting an immaculate sound through inspirations far removed from techno, he presented an opus that favoured ambiences and immersive urban soundscapes. The LP marked a decisive moment in Drumcode’s evolution, establishing Layton’s nouveau strain of modern techno as a focal part of the label’s output from then on.\n\nLayton’s recent studio work has continued to shine. His Hyperworld EP released during the pandemic (5 million streams on Spotify), his 2022 high-energy collaboration with HI-LO Rabbit Hole (3 mil), the Digital Age EP (2 mil) and his remix of the seminal Sam Paganini hit Rave which he created with Adam Beyer and Bart Skils (6.6 million streams) - all added to his ever increasing growth trajectory.\n\nToday Life Moves Fast for Layton. His incoming Phantom EP for Drumcode is set to ignite dancefloors through the ’23 Festival season and so too is Layton & Zimmz remix of the seminal anthem Olive “You’re Not Alone” which lands on Sony in August. Also incoming is Layton’s dynamic remix of Voicemail by Green Velvet and Patrick Topping which lands in July on Cajual.\n\nDiving headfirst into his music and live appearances with unmatched tenacity, Layton has achieved more in a matter of years than most artists hope for in a lifetime and yet this story is still in its infancy. His unapologetic approach to composition and his hunger for knowledge, sincerity and sonic excellence have ensured Layton’s status as one of techno’s elite in 2023.\n\nRespectful of the past but with his eyes always firmly on the future he continues to entrench himself on the front lines as one of techno’s new school that continues to push forwards with the sounds of tomorrow.",

In what can only be described as one of the break-out stories of the decade, Drugs From Amsterdam originator Mau P has indisputably left his mark on the dance music scene since his debut single was released.\n\nBorn Maurits Westveen into a family brimming with musical genius, the artist within was destined to come out at some point. Starting a career as DJ and producer Maurice West, he quickly made his way onto world’s premier stages and into the hearts of many. Despite everything seemingly running smoothly, the Maurice West project had run its course and a seismic shift was in the works. Fast forward to today and Mau P is reaping the rewards of a leap of faith, the wager on his artistry paying off in a spectacular manner.\n\nHis debut single rocketed from the underground to become a huge global hit with close to two hundred million streams across platforms. Drugs From Amsterdam cracked the charts, topped Beatport’s prestigious Top 10 for over a month and turned out to be the beginning of a meteoric upwards trajectory.\n\nMau P released the follow up, Gimme That Bounce, in January 2023, right as he was embarking on his first North America tour. A tour that sold out shows from coast to coast. The summer that followed, Mau P was firing on all cylinders, releasing official remixes for the Swedish House Mafia, Calvin Harris and Armand van Helden as well as his original collaboration with Kevin de Vries, Metro on Afterlife. The latter of which became the most played track of Tomorrowland 2023, only to be followed in second place by Drugs From Amsterdam.\n\nIn 2023 Mau P also released Your Mind Is Dirty and Dress Code, which both turned out hugely successful in their own right. Over the course of his first full year in business, Mau P graced acclaimed stages across the globe, from EDC Las Vegas to Tomorrowland and from Hï Ibiza to Amsterdam Dance Event, winning over fans one beat at a time. It was this foundation of high profile performances and successful releases that set up Mau P for a truly spectacular start to 2024.\n\n2024 has truly been THE year of Mau P – starting the year with a triple threat with the release of BEATS FOR THE UNDERGROUND, a new SiriusXM radio show, XXX Radio, and being added to Wynn Las Vegas’ roster of resident DJs. The year has seen the release of hits including his first vocal track, On Again, with legendary producer Mike Dean, Receipts with Diplo and Gunna, and Merther, featuring the legendary sample from Ini Kamoze’s ‘World A Music’. Not to mention, viral performances from his B2B performance with Diplo on Coachella's new Quasar stage, to bringing the iconic Breaking Bad duo Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul on stage with him at Encore Beach Club in Las Vegas.\n\n2024 also saw the official introduction of Mau P’s own multidisciplinary show concept, BADDEST BEHAVIOUR, which debuted with an instantly sold-out show in New York’s Knockdown Centre. From there, Mau P brought the concept to Floyd during Miami Music Week, Mission Ballroom in Denver and most notably, sold-out back-to-back takeovers of New York and Los Angeles in September. With FOUR SOLD-OUT shows between Brooklyn’s Under The K Bridge and Los Angeles’s Shrine Auditorium & Expo Hall, the bi-coast installation of Mau P’s BADDEST BEHAVIOUR concept brought more than 25,000 fans flocking to see the icon play.\n\nIt is indeed not often that an artist of Mau P’s caliber comes along, as demonstrated by a jaw-dropping list of accolades achieved in just 18 months. Looking back to August 2022, it’s safe to say that Mau P has broken the mold. As he continues to carve out his section of the dance music industry, Mau P will remain the name to watch for some time to come.",

      "bio": "One of the most energetic local EDM DJs today, Mr. Brooks does not show any mercy whatsoever when it comes his time to take over the dance floor. Pumping out powerful trance/progressive tracks left and right; he can rock the whole floor and have you screaming for more. He has shared the main stage with many artists such as: Dash Berlin, W&W, Arty, Sean Tyas, Rank1, Tritonal and Aly & Fila.. Be on the look out for him, because this rising artist is not to be missed.\n\n//\n\nMy name is Jovan Brooks (Mr. Brooks). I fell in love with the sound of electronic music at a young age. My first gig at a big backyard house party was what really made me pursue this as a dream goal, to play electronic music for the many people that love to dance. Every time I am on the stage I feel as if I am telling a story through my music. Being on that stage is my freedom of self-expression, a way to let loose. As of recent, I have been learning different ways and doing my own productions in the studio as well as performing on stage alongside international artists.\n\nInterview\n---------\n\n* * *\n\n**Home Town:** Los Angeles, CA  \n**Currently Living:** Riverside, CA  \n**Origin Of Name:** Got tired of thinking of a new DJ name, so I just used my last name and added “Mr.” to it…and then a year later, some movie comes out with my name, funny.  \n**Weapon of Choice:** My mind...it’s loaded with ideas  \n**Source of Power:** Other electronic music artists from around the world that work hard and strive to be on top.\n\n**Was there one particular moment in the recording or mixing process for your Discovery Project entry that made you feel like you were creating something pretty damn special?**  \nDuring the final mix down…I felt that this track was very well “out of the box” than from what I usually listen to or create. Very simple, but mix down and groovy. I felt it was special to experiment with something out of the box and have it come together nicely in the end.\n\n**Are there any dots to connect with where/how you grew up to your musical output?**  \nI just loved a lot of electronic and techno music back in high school so I got a hold of some cheap turntables and did it for fun out of my bedroom. Hardhouse came out, so I started to like it and played at numerous house parties. Then I started to question how this music was being made. So I went out and started messing around with sounds on my computer.\n\n**What do your parents think of what you are doing?**  \nThey love it! They think I’m a mobile wedding DJ or something.\n\n**What’s the strangest part of your job?**  \nSeeing diehard people in the front row dancing like there is no tomorrow to a one-hour plus set. At my age today, I would not be able to keep up.\n\n**What’s the biggest misconception about being a DJ?**  \nEveryone thinks it’s all about going up on stage, pressing a button, and waving your hands in the air (like you just don’t care). But really it’s more about track selection, how to read a crowd, what would you like to hear if you were one of those people in the front row, and how to stand out from the rest. Marketing also comes into play, you have to market yourself if you want to be heard, right? How to bring your brand to the table.\n\n**Tell me about your most memorable night out.**  \nPlaying at Nocturnal Wonderland, 2012. It was such a great feeling to step into my own trailer, pop open a cold one, and relax with a couple of my good friends prior to taking the stage in the “Upside Down” room.\n\n**Do you have any memorable moments from past EDC's or any other Insomniac party?**  \nI really had a blast when I played at the very first Awakening show in San Bernardino years ago. Infected Mushroom and John 00 Fleming headlined.\n\n**How does what you do for a living affect you on a day-to-day basis?**  \nSometimes it can be difficult to switch from one thing to the other—such as having a full-time job, doing graphic design on the side and then trying to jump in the studio right after that. It affects my family and friends a lot because I don’t see them that much because of my schedule. It would be easier if I can just focus on one main thing to make ends meet.\n\n**What is your ultimate career dream?**  \nTo travel the world and play music for the entire human race.\n\n**Are you impulsive with your work or do you have a sketch in mind before you start?**  \nDJing I usually make up my tracklisting a couple days before the gig, and play them in the order that I feel is necessary, sometimes I’ll make a decision on whether to play a certain track next or to drop the next track from a mix. In producing, I usually know what I’m going to put down by humming melodies or weird noises with my mouth. Yes, it’s weird but it does help me get a jump-start on a track.\n\n**How, if at all, does listening to music figure into your creative process?**  \nCertain music that I have not heard before can sometimes make me think on how I can evolve that sound into a different sound and make it sound even better. Tracks that sound really good that have very minimal sounds and are simple seem to get my attention the most.. One of those tracks is “Toxic Rush” by Jewelz & Scott Sparks, after hearing it, I hit the studio.\n\n**What’s the most important piece of gear in your studio?**  \nMy Intel I7 desktop...it’s the core of everything I design and produce.\n\n**How important is it for you to experiment and take on the risk of failure?**  \nVery. Because you might discover something ideal that no one will discover.\n\n**Do you have a list of people you’d like to collaborate with in the future?**  \nMichael Calderone. Mike Targanski. Johnny Yono. Mikkas. These guys have been very influential in what I do. They are the reason I keep on pushing in the studio for many hours trying to develop a sound and to not give up this passion.\n\n**If we pressed Shuffle on your iPod while you went to the bathroom, what would you be embarrassed to come back to us listening to?**  \nProbably some old R&B shit...Don’t hate!\n\n**What sound or noise do you love?**  \nThe kind that is not redlining.\n\n**What should everyone just shut the fuck up about?**  \nSwag.\n\n**What gets you excited when you think about the future of electronic music and club culture?**  \nThe evolving sounds and the growth of electronic music, it has come a long way and changed so much from when I first heard the music.\n\n**When you look at electronic music and the surrounding culture, what worries you about the future?**  \nGhost production that is becoming way too common and easy to get a hold of, as easy as going to a website and downloading a track to call your own when that person has not even created it. This bothers me a lot because there is a lot of great talent out there that are busting their asses in the studio but not really getting the recognition they deserve. Artists should be recognized for the actual projects they create.\n\n**What are your weaknesses?**  \nKryptonite…LOL. I kid, I’m not superman. I would like to think that my greatest weakness is expecting too much from myself on every task I handle. I am learning how to sometimes relax and ask for help where and when I should.\n\n**Do you have a secret passion?**  \nJust one, but it’s not a secret—music.\n\n**Is success physical or internal?**  \nInternal, it means happiness for me. To accomplish and to work towards my dream as long as I keep pushing towards it and making a difference to people in doing what we love.\n\n**What do you remember about your first DJ gig?**  \nI remember I was sweating and very nervous because I did not know what to expect or how the crowd will react to my music. As soon as I got to take over the decks, I don’t remember a thing because the music took control and took over the crowd.\n\n**What’s the hardest professional lesson you’ve learned thus far?**  \nMusic theory, in general. To me that is the most important thing to have under your belt. How to keep sounds in “key” and how to progress and build your sound and arrangement. Main thing is not to be “tone def.” You can have a big track with big sounds, but if it’s all off-key and you got “Arps” going all over the place then it will sound like a pile of crap in the end. I took the time and had to read and watch the same thing over and over in order to finally hit me up-side the head and say, “Ohhhhhh, I get it now.”\n\n**What advice would you offer someone thinking about entering the Discovery Project competition?**  \nDon’t be afraid to think outside the box. Just do it and take your time. Don’t worry too much about today’s sound. Come with what you feel sounds good, be yourself and free your mind.\n\n**Winning Mix:**\n\n**Winning Track:**",

In 2015, Skrillex dropped Tyler’s previously unreleased single “Street” on Ultra Music Festival’s main stage - a career defining moment that led to his ascent to stardom as NGHTMRE. Now, 10 years into the project, NGHTMRE is a heavyweight champion in both EDM and hip-hop, with his own Gud Vibrations record label co-curated alongside SLANDER and with release collaborations from ZHU, The Chainsmokers, Gunna, Tory Lanez, A$AP Ferg, Dillon Francis, and more. A philosopher of sound design, his sweltering sets are infused with field recordings and unorthodox samples to create immersive, inimitable listening experiences. With his tenured residency at Hakkasan Las Vegas, headlining performances across Australia, Europe, and Asia, appearances at festivals like Coachella, Bonnaroo, Ultra, Electric Forest along with international events like EDC Mexico, Tomorrowland, Lollapalooza France, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and performances at legendary venues like Bill Graham Auditorium, Tacoma Dome, Aragon Ballroom, Terminal 5, Grand Park in LA and many more, NGHTMRE is an icon both in the studio and on stage. 2023 saw NGHTMRE collaborating with notable contemporaries like REZZ, Knock2, and Big Gigantic (releasing the eponymous debut EP from the collaborative project, Gigantic NGHTMRE), while also writing the last chapters of his 2022 debut feature-length album DRMVRSE with an 18-track Deluxe Edition accompanied by a mini-documentary chronicling the deep, thoughtful concept of the live-oriented project. As NGHTMRE’s ambitious, B2B double-headliner Sonic Wars tour of North America comes to a close into 2024, he now looks ahead to the new year with lots of music to release and stages around the world to play it live.",

Throughout their musical progression, Narciss has been indefatigable in their endeavors, which are motivated by the connection and catharsis that their music cultivates. This desire to share the transformative powers of music has not only imbued their output with an enticing and revelrous timbre, it has fostered collaborations with like-minded souls like Gerd Janson and DJ Boring, among others.\n\n“There’s a red thread that I’ve been weaving through my life” says Narciss of their journey. As an artist, a queer person, a partner, and a human, the road they’ve walked has changed as it has changed them. The story unfolding thus far, in singles and EP’s as stanzas and chapters, tells of their trials and of their persistence in overcoming them. Styles evolved and sounds found and discarded alike, Narciss carries what they need and leaves to the past what’s in the past. The constant throughout their life and career, which is at the heart of their creative expression, is both a personal mantra and manifestation of their oeuvre - Per Aspera Ad Astra, “through hardships to the stars.”",

      "bio": "One of Belgium's top drum'n'bass producers, Netsky (Boris Daenen) made his name producing deep, smoothly rolling tracks in the liquid funk style before achieving chart success in Europe and the U.K. with his increasingly pop-minded singles and full-lengths. Following a series of hotly tipped 2009 singles, he signed to London Elektricity's renowned Hospital Records and released his self-titled debut the following year. Since 2012, Netsky has toured with a full band, in addition to releasing two numerically titled albums, both of which topped the Belgian charts, and his sound has expanded to encompass dubstep, hip-hop, and electro-house.\n\nTaking his stage name from a computer worm affecting Microsoft Windows operating systems, Daenen's first releases as Netsky first appeared in 2009, on independent drum'n'bass labels like Talkin Beatz and Liq-weed Ganja. His melodic, energetic sound made him a natural fit for Hospital Records, who signed him at the end of the year. The debut full-length Netsky appeared in 2010, showcasing Daenen's ability to switch between rigorous dancefloor tracks and full-blown songs with guest vocalists. After collaborating with labelmate Danny Byrd on the 2011 single \"Tonight,\" Netsky's second album, 2, was released in 2012. Reaching the top spot in his native country in addition to charting high in New Zealand and the U.K., the album included four Belgian Top 20-charting singles and guest vocals by Diane Charlemagne and Billie, both of whom toured as part of the Netsky live band. By then, he was an in-demand remix producer, having reworked songs by Swedish House Mafia, Miike Snow, Jessie J, and several others.\n\n\"Running Low,\" a collaboration with American singer Beth Ditto, was released in 2014, and became Netsky's first number one single in his native country. Signing with Epic Records, he released his third album, 3, in 2016. Sporting a noticeably poppier sound and featuring guest appearances from the likes of Emeli Sandé, Saint Raymond, Lowell, and the peculiarly named Digital Farm Animals, the album was another success, topping the Belgian charts while hitting the Top Ten of the dance charts in the U.K. and the United States. He followed the album with the 2017 single \"Here with You\" (with Lost Frequencies) and 2018's \"Téquila Limonada\" (featuring A.CHAL). In 2019 Netsky teamed up Aloe Blacc with for the single \"Snitch.\" 2020 brought the release of Netsky's fourth album, Second Nature, a lengthy 18-track set that featured guests like Becky Hill, Rudimental, and Hybrid Minds. ~ Andy Kellman & Paul Simpson, Rovi",

Making his debut on the Chris Lake and Skrillex curated ‘HOWSLA’ in 2017 with ‘Lasers’ before catching the eyes and ears of French label boss Tchami. His follow up release saw the Jungle EP, an instant live anthem supported by Diplo, Oliver Heldens, A-Trak, Jauz, Malaa and more.\n\n2018 started with singles ‘LFO’ and ‘Wavey’, gaining huge support from Sirius / Diplo Revolution. The latter in particular receiving over 200 plays.\n\nNoizu’s first official remix came when he was asked by DJ Snake himself to tackle his Lauv featured smash ‘A Different Way’, which boasts over 4.8M Spotify streams at present.\n\nA champion for other new talent, Noizu has always given away his own stems post-release to encourage other young producers and has released several remix EPs highlighting the best new talent he can find.\n\nOther official remix offers came in and he selected songs by Tchami and Valentino Khan. He also took the idea of re-working the classic house anthem “Music Sounds Better with You” to his now friend Malaa. The song was released as a bootleg and has had over 1M Soundcloud plays and tens of thousands of downloads.\n\nWith a growing urge to adopt a label boss attitude, he set up Techné Records summer of 2018 with a view to working club releases globally and giving new talent a platform to show their skills. The debut release, a collaboration with Dombresky, could not have gone better. ‘Rave Alarm’ was launched and an instant festival anthem was subsequently made “Hottest Record in the World” by Annie Mac for BBC Radio 1. A top 10 Aria club track in Australia, this track has now been licensed and will receiving a big push with video in 2019. November 2018 saw Noizu make his LA debut, a packed headline show at Sound Nightclub. An incredible landmark for a project barely 18 months old but a true testament to the pace and quality of which the project is heading towards.\n\nCruising straight into 2019, Noizu started off the year with the much-anticipated release of ‘DANCE’ on Chris Lake’s Black Book Records, which quickly gained the support of some of dance music’s top names including FISHER, Chris Lake, Green Velvet, Claude VonStroke and more. After a packed set at Beyond Wonderland, Noizu gifted fans with his second release of the year ‘No More’ which gained the same ongoing traction of everything before it. Having already been played by some of the top DJs at major events around the world including Miami Music Week and Lollapalooza Argentina, this track is not one to be slept on. The year will undoubtedly continue to deliver more top-quality music on a host of respected labels as the ever-growing list of A-List support, co-signs and fan awareness grows.\n\nNoizu is a project that will take over in 2019 and 2020.",

Developing a flair for identifying unique sounds, he has become known for his ability to diversify across genres, emphasizing the unconventional. Spending years meticulously honing his craft, Odd Mob has firmly planted himself at the forefront of electronic music’s future.\n\nOdd Mob broke through with the ubiquitous 2014 track ‘Is It A Banger’, a track that resonated with Australian listeners, charting in triple j’s ‘Hottest 100’ and has since amassed over 7 million streams across platforms. The boundary-pushing producer showed no signs of slowing down, subsequently releasing tracks ‘Intrinsic’, and ‘Lithium’, which saw Odd Mob surpass well over 20 million streams across platforms, not to mention ‘Intrinsic’ collecting a nomination for an AIR (Australian Independent Labels) award in 2019. An ever-present name on the ARIA Club Charts, time and time again Odd Mob has proven his versatility and talent both in the studio and behind the decks.\n\n2022 saw the release of ‘Strut’ where Odd Mob collaborated with House Music icon Roland Clark, as well as an official remake of the timeless Planet Funk classic ‘Chase The Sun’. From remakes, vocal tracks, remixes, and right through to his original productions Odd Mob is non-stop flexing his production prowess. With a genre-defying catalogue of songs, he has given back to his audience fashioning bootlegs under his Oddities brand, which have amassed millions of plays. Constantly pushing boundaries in his expertly crafted creations has earned Odd Mob the support of a plethora of industry heavyweights including the likes of Diplo, DJ Snake, Jauz, Oliver Heldens, Cloonee, Don Diablo, Tommy Trash, and Disclosure.\n\nNo stranger to electrifying heat-seeking crowds, Odd Mob signed with US booking agency, Agency for the Performing Arts (APA) in 2018, sharing the roster with the likes of 50 Cent, Tyga, Dead Letter Circus, Azelia Banks, T.I, The Delta Riggs and Blondie. Odd Mob has since completed an 8 stop tour of the USA and Canada in late 2019, before an additional 11 stop tour in 2020 was scheduled prior to the pandemic. Locally, he has played at some of Australia’s biggest festivals Beyond The Valley, Groovin The Moo, Future Music Festival, Stereosonic, Mountain Sounds, The Big Pineapple and Summer Sounds Sessions.\n\nOdd Mob’s most recent single ‘LEFT TO RIGHT’ has been a huge leap back into the spotlight with a slew of AAA tastemaker support from the likes of Dom Dolla, Disclosure, Diplo, Chris Lake, ACRAZE, and John Summit, to name a few, all showcasing this record in their sets in the past few months, resulting in an online treasure hunt from fans to find the record. The song is based around portions of the Soulja Boy cult classic ‘Crank That’ which has had the blessing and sign off from Soulja Boy himself. ‘LEFT TO RIGHT” is out everywhere from August 12th, 2022.  \n  \n2024 will see Odd Mob continue on his rapid trajectory to the top with a slew of North American back to back tours throughout May, June, August and October, as well as his first ever European tour playing at the likes of Tomorrowland, Parookaville and Elrow @ Amnesia (Ibiza), with more to be announced shortly.",

      "name": "Paul Oakenfold",
      "bio": "“Pete Tong said it perfectly: getting a release on Perfecto is like a badge of honor,” Paul Oakenfold recalls. “A dance music badge of honor! Those words really meant a lot to me as we began to consider how to properly pay tribute to Perfecto’s first three decades as a record label.”\n\nPete Tong, of course, is dance music’s longtime tastemaker supreme—but don’t just take Tongy’s word for it: in 2003, none other than the late Queen Elizabeth bestowed an award on Oakenfold on behalf of the British Empire as a “Pioneer of the Nation” for his contributions to dance music. All aspects of that legacy are coming together with “Perfecto 30”: an expansive series debuting in 2023-2024 spanning unique global events, musical releases, and exclusive artist/DJ performances that reflect not just 30-plus years of the Perfecto imprint’s success, but the goalpost-moving achievements of Oakenfold, Perfecto’s co-founder and figurehead, as well. Indeed, it’s hard to separate Perfecto’s landmarks from Oakenfold’s storied history as arguably the first global superstar DJ, paving the way from Ibiza and the Glastonbury main stage to smash Las Vegas residencies; as a hit-making producer for everyone from Happy Mondays to Madonna and U2; a pioneer of contemporary electronic music soundtracks for games and hit Hollywood movies like Swordfish and Bourne Identity; and an innovator of DJ culture across genres, crucial in bringing underground club sounds from trance to EDM to a worldwide mainstream audience (and that’s just a partial list).\n\n“Paul’s attitude in starting Perfecto was quite visionary, quite refreshing—I think he started a brand, really, that also happened to be a label,” Tong notes in the upcoming documentary Welcome to Perfecto. “Perfecto 30 is really the umbrella for it all,” Oakenfold explains. In addition to the release of Welcome to Perfecto (which features additional commentary from the legendary likes of Fatboy Slim, Carl Cox, Todd Terry, and David Guetta, along with cultural perspective Mixmag’s Nick Stevenson and DJ Times editor Carl Loben), Perfecto 30 will include a series of remixes and DJ mix recordings featuring everyone Oaky OGs like Carl Cox to new jacks like Franky Wah.\n\nMeanwhile, Oakenfold himself will make a series of special DJ appearances crisscrossing America and the UK to Ibiza and Australia—many involving the parties, festivals, and superclubs like Cream where he made his name; in them, he plans to revisit Perfecto classics and deep cuts like PPK’s “ResuRection,” Planet Perfecto’s “Bullet in a Gun,” and his own smashes like “Starry Eyed Surprise” (the hit collaboration with Crazy Town’s Shifty Shellshock from Oakenfold’s platinum debut solo album, 2002’s Bunkka).\n\nOakenfold also promises a special event at an epic, unexpected venue where dance music has never been played before, which is no small promise. After all, he was the first DJ to play Stonehenge, Area 51, the Great Wall of China, and base camp at Mount Everest—and when he played at the Special Olympics in Abu Dhabi, his set was broadcast to over 760 million worldwide households. “All I can say is we’re looking at one of the oldest cathedrals in England,” Oakenfold notes with a mischievous smile. Most of all, “Perfecto 30” will celebrate the full heritage and influence of the dance-music empire Oakenfold has built—from helping create DJ superstars out of the likes of Hernán Cattáneo, Mark Ronson, and David Guetta to bringing underground dance sounds to fresh ears. “I can honestly say, Perfecto tipped me onto house music,” Fatboy Slim claims, pointing to hearing early Perfecto classic “I’ll Be Your Friend” by house-music legend Robert Owens at a Brighton club as a career-changing epiphany. “I learned trance from Paul Oakenfold,” Todd Terry admits in Welcome to Perfecto, citing his groundbreaking mix CDs like Another World and the Tranceport series. Indeed, with trance revivalists like Evian Christ currently redefining the big room sounds Oakenfold popularized and neo-electronic groups like Sextile exploring the Manchester grooves he helped produce in the studio for Happy Mondays, Perfecto’s diverse sound remains more relevant than ever.\n\nAcross the main Perfecto imprint and its four sub-labels—Perfecto Records, Perfecto Fluoro, Perfecto Black, and Perfecto House—the label has touched nearly every significant dance movement of modern times, from progressive, trance, and EDM but also drum and bass, Balearic, electro, and beyond; as such, on his last artist album, 2022’s Shine On, Oakenfold found himself collaborating with a diverse creative crew including CeeLo, Luis Fonsi, Aloe Blacc, Azealia Banks, and Zhu. Oakenfold points out Perfecto 30 will also launch a number of releases of today’s most cutting-edge dance-music artists and producers including Velvet Cash, Danny Stubbs, Blink, Adam White, and Nat Monday. Oakenfold’s syndicated Perfecto Radio show, meanwhile, still draws 25 million listeners internationally on a weekly basis to hear him spin his latest tunes and dancefloor discoveries.\n\nFor the next chapter of Perfecto, meanwhile, Oakenfold claims he’s returning to the roots of the label’s original mission. “I’m going back to doing straight club records—underground tracks that I love,” Oakenfold says. “You have to understand, Perfecto is now a thirty-year-old brand: there are generations that have grown up with the sound. They got into dance music and have grown up with the label, collecting our vinyl from day one. It’s turned into much more than a label. So to celebrate that spirit, I’m just going to do what I’m good at and really love—and go out in a blaze of glory for my last dance!”",

They crossed paths in the early 2010s, joining forces as producers in 2013, originally pursuing deep house before moving into classic rave sounds.

      "name": "Pryda",
      "bio": "For over ten years, Eric Prydz has been synonymous with immaculately produced and unique sounding electronic music. The Platinum-selling producer is responsible for some of the biggest progressive house tracks of the last decade, not to mention some of the most technically impressive live shows of any touring artist. As a solo artist, Prydz has headlined some of the world’s most storied venues, from Madison Square Garden to Brixton Academy and Alexandra Palace, earned multiple Grammy nominations, hosted an ongoing radio show for Beats1 and topped charts with his alter-egos Pryda and Cirez D. Despite the headline-grabbing shows and releases, Prydz remains reclusive. It’s his dedication to his craft as a producer and DJ that leaves him in the highly enviable and singular position of appealing to dance music’s underground connoisseurs and main-stage masses alike. This appeal is most evident in Prydz’s debut album, OPUS. Its title track graced festival main stages and blacked-out warehouses alike, and its spine-tingling, slow-burn beauty made a fan out of Four Tet, who ended up remixing it for himself. A project ten years in the making, the two-disc, 19-track album balances pop and prog house, and euphoria and melancholy, in a career-spanning capsule that, according to Pitchfork, “confirms him as both a master craftsman and a masterful manipulator of emotions.” OPUS was named one of the best dance albums of the year by Rolling Stone, Billboard, SPIN and more. Prydz began building his craft in Stockholm, Sweden, where he played extended intimate club gigs while constructing his artistic identity. Here, Prydz refined his signature sound, blending together influences as varied as Depeche Mode, Parliament, and Swedish techno legend Cari Lekebusch. It’s little wonder, then, that Prydz has refused to constrain himself to one sound, and indeed is behind two of electronic music’s most celebrated monikers, Pryda and Cirez D. Pryda is Prydz’s most well-known alias, one whose sound is replicated endlessly in dance music. Listen to the discographies of any current electronic music success and you can hear Pryda’s influence -- the ‘Pryda Sound,’ comprised of immaculately layered melodies and harmonies, is now almost a sub-genre unto itself. Pryda’s origins can be traced back to 2004, with the releases of “Aftermath” (2005), “Muranyi” (2007) and “Pjanoo” (2008) solidifying the Pryda name within the new breed of progressive house. The 2012 release of the three-disc album, Eric Prydz Presents Pryda, offers a full retrospective of one of dance music’s most storied discographies. Cirez D offers a stark contrast to the rich melodies of Pryda, its stripped-back techno dark, raw, and designed for ominous warehouses and long, late-night sets. It’s a deliberate point of focus for Prydz, who relishes playing those environments, and Cirez D, like his other monikers, offers him the freedom to make and release the records that he wants to play, unconstrained by expectations. Prydz’s productions are only one half of the story. As a DJ, he’s been celebrated as one of the most consistent live performers around. It’s not only his abilities that set him apart, but the vision behind his performances. In 2011, Prydz debuted EPIC (Eric Prydz In Concert) at London’s Brixton Academy. At its core, EPIC offered a way to visually experience Eric’s music, its pioneering use of holograms and sheer ambition of scale wowing the industry. EPIC’s subsequent iterations have only grown from there: EPIC 2.0 made its way stateside, EPIC 3.0 filled up New York’s iconic Madison Square Garden, while the sold-out EPIC 4.0 tour, earned praise from Resident Advisor for his ability to “create a common ground between a techno fan and a candy raver.” In May 2017, Prydz performed EPIC 5.0 in London, his biggest show to date. Selling 15,000 tickets in under 4 hours was a major achievement for the EPIC series. Summer 2017 also saw Prydz host his debut Ibiza residency, filling Hï Ibiza for 10 weeks throughout the season. He also introduced another bespoke production which was designed and installed by his EPIC team, which proved to be a major success, and more importantly groundbreaking for Ibiza. Residing in Los Angeles, Eric Prydz continues to set himself apart in electronic music through his visceral productions and exhilarating live shows.",

      "bio": "An artist's second album is career-defining. The first full-length project serves as an introduction — and, if an artist can deliver on their vision, as Los Angeles-based RL Grime did with hisfirst album, VOID, in 2014 — it is well-received and critically acclaimed. The sophomore album, however, answers the biggest question that any artist faces — not just if they canconsistently deliver, but consistently innovate.\n\nSuch is the stage set for RL Grime's second album. RL Grime first came to prominence as a New York-based teenager delivering monster, viral remixes of Chief Keef's \"Love Sosa\" and Kanye West's \"Mercy.\" He established himself as a unique artist in his space with a striking monochromatic aesthetic, a series of animated music videos, and an annual Halloween mix that has included drops from Goosebumps author RL Stine, comedian Hannibal Buress, and Tony Hawk. After solidifying his fanbase with a few highly-regarded EPs, RL Grime independently released his first studio album, \"VOID,\" in 2014. It premiered as the #1 Electronic album in the United States and remained in that position for a month.\n\nAt that point — with over 150 million plays, rave reviews and magazine covers, and sets at the biggest festivals in the world including Coachella & Lollapalooza — most artists would settle for their success. RL Grime stuck to his underground roots and further limited his releases. He made rare appearances in collaborations with artists including Big Sean, Miguel, and Skrillex, and starred in Alexander Wang's #WANGSQUAD alongside Travis Scott & Zoe Kravitz. In late 2017, he emerged with \"Era,\" a tour-de-force single that Billboard described as \"exotic, massive, and full-of-left-turns.\" Its epic, cinematic sound announced a new era and an accompanying album: NOVA.\n\nRL Grime's uncompromising artistry has paid off. NOVA was preceded by a sold-tour that included stops in Australia, Los Angeles, and New York. Its hype has only swelled in the absence of information surrounding the album, leaving fans and blogs to their own speculation. With NOVA, RL Grime looks to further distinguish himself as an innovator in music, treading the line between millions of fans and an independent sound, the underground and the accessible, popular music and real art.",

The bass music extraordinaire is always close to the most enviable sonic spots and playing gigs at premier festivals like Glastonbury, ADE, Tomorrowland and Sonar. RayRay took to the sonic realm from very early on, where a true love story with sculpting beats unfurled when she was just 17. Initially on the hip-hop tip, she organically gravitated to the electronic music cartel, making her a diverse addition to the ever-evolving music industry. Today RayRay is an artist always in flux and is anything but generic—she has fueled a fierce open format style that is an intricately textured amalgamation of hip hop, EDM, Miami bass, tech house, trap and drumstep.   What really turned up the volume however was a justified win at the Red Bull Thre3style competition and a couple of studio sessions with artists like Skrillex, Yellow Claw, and Atmozfears, and then the next chapter in her musical story was ablaze. Her reputation for injecting a savage signature sound into all her releases soon floated past the ears of Yellow Claw who quickly signed her to Barong Family where she released two EPs: 'Purple Alien' and 'Alien Invasion'. RayRay’s new home on the Dutch imprint has got her name on feverish demand and today she’s touring her propulsive sound all over the globe, creating seismic experiences for her newfound fans.",

      "name": "Rezz",
      "bio": "Though young at 23 years of age, REZZ is anything but an amateur. Producing state of the art, genre-bending works, while striking a sharp balance between bass heavy and minimal tech compositions, she oozes originality and stands shoulder to shoulder with the very best in the electronic music scene. With a handful of EPs and a full album now under her belt, \"Space Mom\" returns in 2018 with 'Certain Kind Of Magic,' her sophomore album released on mau5trap.\n\nStarting out as a local DJ in her hometown of Niagara Falls, she was still a teen when she decided that music production was the path she would take. After studying sound design extensively at home and psychology as an aid to her creative process, her experimentation, dedication and hard work paid off in paving the way for a long career ahead as a highly regarded producer of downtempo soundscapes.\n\nREZZ's headstrong decisiveness and clear vision are arguably the keys to her success so far. She began to build a following on Soundcloud with a series of free releases that caught the ears of electronic music icons Skrillex and deadmau5. Skrillex subsequently brought her talent to the masses by organizing the release of REZZ's debut three-track 'Insurrection' EP on OWSLA's The Nest imprint in 2015, which was critically acclaimed and universally lauded, with REZZ being dubbed a \"prodigy\" (EDM.com) and the \"Queen of the Dark Techno Scene\" (MTV) in the media.\n\nIn 2016, REZZ answered the calls from her fans and released ' The Silence Is Deafening ' EP on deadmau5's mau5trap imprint. This launched REZZ into the upper echelons of the electronic music scene, leading to the creation of the 'Cult of REZZ' fan base. Her follow-up EP on mau5trap in October 2016 ' Something Wrong Here ' caught the attention of the international media, as REZZ began selling out shows around the world.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, with worldwide intrigue for REZZ piquing, she dropped her full-length debut ' Mass Manipulation ' album on mau5trap. The album consistently portrays menacing soundscapes that REZZ is known for through innovative singles and collaborations. Her forward thinking and unique mentality did not go unnoticed, as she was awarded with a JUNO for Electronic Album of the Year for her work on 'Mass Manipulation. '\n\n'Certain Kind of Magic,' released in the summer of 2018 represents REZZ's sonic growth and development as an artist. The eight track album is a testament to her ability to demand a listener's attention through, as DJ Mag describes, \"Rezazadeh's uncanny ability to tread the line between desire and tension.\" With worldwide and critical acclaim pouring in from the likes of Billboard (who dubbed her Billboard Dance Breakout Artist of the Year ), Mixmag, Dancing Astronaut, and many more is testament to the fact that REZZ has truly become a tastemaker and trendsetter in the industry.\n\nAlongside the new album, REZZ embarked on her second sold-out headline tour through many major markets in North America in Fall 2018, including Red Rocks in Colorado, and two nights at legendary Los Angeles venue The Shrine.",

      "name": "Rusko",
      "bio": "Hello, world: Rusko kindly requests that you wake the fuck up. The Leeds-born DJ/producer who ascended with the original U.K. dubstep movement — and gave it one of its first and most enduring anthems, a bolt of foul-mouthed rave lightning called “Cockney Thug” — is here to tell you that music is not about labels and dance is no fad.\n\nAnd to prove it, he proudly presents “SONGS”: His gutsy, freewheeling, brilliant second album. “The sound of my early releases was very dub-influenced, and just good, fun, bouncy vibes,” he says. “The majority of dubstep at the moment I think is aggressive, and I don’t like angry music; I don’t want to be angry in a club. So I wanted to make something really happy, but still heavy.”\n\n“Happy and heavy” is a proper way to describe the vibe that has carried Rusko from the first moments of dubstep’s life to the biggest stages in the world; from a single, seminal bass wobble to a swath of sounds that can’t be capped in a few simple syllables. He might be one of the guys who started it all — but he’s sure as hell not going to leave it at that.\n\nA staple of the global electronic underground, Rusko has packed nightclubs, concert venues, and festivals across the world, and not only dance-dedicated ones: From Electric Daisy Carnival and Ultra Music Festival, to Coachella and Lollapalooza; from Germany’s Melt! to Australia’s Good Vibrations.\n\nHe created the majority of “O.M.G.!,” his hard-hitting debut artist album, on the road, cutting tracks by day, and testing them on living, breathing dance floors by night. But for the follow-up, he wanted to try a different strategy. “From January to late September 2011, I didn’t make a single track,” he says. “I spent all that time touring around the world, building up a massive swell of ideas inside me.”\n\nWith the long tour done, the artist took two months completely off and ensconced himself in a tiny one-room studio in California’s Hollywood Hills, with no phone reception and spotty-at-best Internet access. The hermit style paid off. “I made all 14 songs in 8 weeks,” he says. “I didn’t try any out like before; I just stayed in the same headspace and vibe, and made the whole album in one go. You can really tell: Compared to ‘O.M.G.!,’ it sounds like one crazy Technicolor song!”\n\nThere is indeed a rowdy kind of sprightliness throughout “SONGS,” which sets a wizard’s box of dance music charms to some of its most misunderstood: cracking, smacking breakbeats, and reverberant, sonic-boom bass. The rave piano vamp of first single “Somebody to Love,” the accelerated classic house of “Pressure,” the head-nodding reggae of “Skanker,” the epically trancey sweep of “Opium” and “Thunder,” even “Dirty Sexy,” a tongue-y but not so cheeky nugget of American-style R&B: They all express a different part of what makes Rusko pogo like a punk while he spins, and carry the energy and soul of his inimitable, genre-be-damned style.\n\nBack in 2007 — when “dubstep” was an idea known to a critical few — Rusko and DJ/producer Caspa lit the spark with a dubstep-dedicated mix for London nightclub Fabric’s influential compilation series Fabriclive. Rusko’s “Cockney Thug” was the centerpiece, evangelizing the bass “wobble” that’s since set the world on fire — a seminal moment that the Guardian UK called one of the 50 key events in dance music history.\n\nThe young artist released a slew of singles and EPs, including the “Babylon” series, which shows his transition from happier rave to heavier dub. Remix commissions came in droves: Rusko has put his buoyant spin on over 20 tracks, including Kid Cudi’s “Day ‘N’ Night,” Lady Gaga’s “Alejandro,” and Kid Sister’s “Pro Nails.” He also produced the majority of “Maya,” M.I.A’s third and highest-charting studio album. In 2010, Rusko’s “Cali Anthem” became the first dubstep tune to be listed on US radio, and “O.M.G.!” was released on Mad Decent/Downtown.\n\nContaining tracks like the raucous “Woo Boost” and elegantly aggressive anthem “Hold On” (featuring Amber Coffman from The Dirty Projectors), it cemented the young artist as one of the leaders of the new dance movement. Rusko is touring internationally behind “SONGS,” and preparing to release an EP with a similarly ingenious group of rule-breakers: American hip-hop outfit Cypress Hill.\n\nSo world, if you’re awake, now hear this: Rusko is here to roll the beats, and dance music will never be the same.",

The following summer they met again at the Red Bull Studios LA producing the Foreign Beggars’ Modus EP. This initial studio session led to further collaborations and SHADES was born.\n\nXLR8R have rightly said “music that's not only a legitimate full-frontal assault in the same vein as tunes from that golden era of gluttonous bass and synths, but that embraces that ethos while giving it a more polished feel”.",

      "bio": "As one of the UK’s best-loved selectors Skream has enjoyed the kind of consistency most DJs and producers can only dream of. His passion for collecting and playing music is unrelenting; disco, house, techno and everything in between… it runs deep into his core and he lives it every single day. Still only in his early thirties, Skream has achieved more in the last 15 years than most people do in a lifetime, yet his hunger and enthusiasm is akin to that of a man who is only just getting started…\n\nSkream’s history is well documented; a love affair with music that was triggered by his older brother, Hijak. DJing since he was 11. Making music at 15 and one of the key innovators at the birth of dubstep. All before he’d left his teens. With his place in UK music history already assured, he could have easily kicked back and taken advantage of his legendary status. Instead he opted to make the transition to disco, house and techno, leaving the dubstep world to do his own thing, in typical Skream style.\n\nTracks like ‘Rollercoaster’ (ft. Sam Frank) and his remixes of Duke Dumont ‘Need You’ and ‘Infinity’ by Infinity Ink helped introduce the world to Skream’s shift in styles, while his mix output from 2013, cemented the change in direction seamlessly blending a variety of 4x4 styles across all of his tracks. Parallel to these pivotal releases he also showcased his eclectic tastes at his Skreamizm parties across the UK and the rest of the world, and so a new chapter began.\n\nIn November 2013 he closed his infamous label Disfigured Dubz, unveiling a brand new platform called Of Unsound Mind six months later in May 2014. The label’s ethos is simple; to offer an outlet to Skream’s friends and to give support to the underdogs out there. Of Unsound Mind has clocked over 50 releases since it was launched, introducing artists like Motions, Billy Turner, Melody’s Enemy and Osolot to the world. Skream’s philanthropy is the mark of a man who has remained true to himself throughout his career, no bullshit, just a straight up honest, unfiltered attitude.\n\nOn the production tip, he has never stopped pushing out music, utilising his own platform to deliver a slew of techno cuts, encompassing a range of textures; from the rugged to the emotive - including ‘Face Down In The Water’, ‘Settled’ and the mighty ‘Chronicles’ EP with Billy Turner. Elsewhere, he has signed a variety of releases to labels such as Crosstown Rebels, Dennis Ferrer’s Objectivity and We Are The Brave which unleashed his killer track ‘Poison’ in 2018. He’s also produced a constant flow of remixes for major labels like Warner, FFRR and Sony, plus some of the most influential underground outlets, including Hot Creations, Watergate, VIVa, Snatch! and lots more. His endless creativity fueled by the dance floor - the place where his heart lies and where he feels most at home.\n\nFor the last few years Skream has been showcasing the depth of his musical knowledge at his ‘Open To Close’ parties, playing all night long at venues around the world; every step of the way he played at sold out clubs that were packed out with people who were there just for him. Skream’s name is now so synonymous with delivering quality that ravers will happily pay for a ticket to see him play all night simply because they trust in his ability to entertain them for eight hours or more. For Skream, this is a dream come true, the epitome of success.\n\nTo achieve that kind of trust from the dance floor is rare, and to maintain it is even more extraordinary, but Skream is no ordinary artist and his commitment to music, and his fans, is unparalleled. “There was never any other option,” he says, and that is why he will continue to be one of the UK’s most treasured electronic music artists keeping the legacy of UK rave culture alive until the very end…",

She had her first drum and bass release on Insomniac Records in 2017 and since has released on Bassrush Records and Viper Records. Having represented for some of SoCal's finest, Soothslayer has flexed her skills on the decks for Respect Drum and Bass, Big Booty Bass, Camp Trip, and is a part of Insomniac's own Bassrush crew. She had her first festival debut in 2016 at Nocturnal Wonderland and since has played the Bassrush stage at Beyond Wonderland, EDC Las Vegas, EDC China, Countdown NYE, Project Z and more.

With house music royalty such as CamelPhat & Yousef flying the flag for so long, all eyes now fall on SOSA as Liverpool's new rising star.\n\nRecognised for his hypnotic grooves, SOSA has been busy honing his skills in the studio, perfecting his signature minimal-tech productions. His tracks have picked up support from key tastemakers such as The Martinez Brothers, Michael Bibi, PAWSA, and Jamie Jones, with releases on Cutting Headz, Hottrax, COCO, Solid Grooves RAW, Black Book Records, Moxy Music, Repopulate Mars, Sola, Ultra, Hot Creations, and Ministry of Sound, to name a few.\n\n2022 has been a year of key moments for SOSA, starting with his remix of Chris Lake & NPC's track 'A Drug From God', followed by debuts with Catch & Release, 'Slow Down', and Hot Creations with his collab EP with Prok | Fitch. He also returned to his highly successful COCO imprint with 'No Bueno' & 'NOVELA' before capping off the year with a massive remix of one of the biggest house records of the year in the form of Chris Lorenzo & Cobrah's 'Mami' record. With many highly anticipated releases slated for 2023 already, it's no surprise that SOSA is widely touted as the hottest producer in the minimal tech scene.\n\nOutside of the studio, SOSA maintains a stacked tour diary with a plethora of performances at the biggest and best venues and festivals across the globe. His sets at premier UK venues like Blackstone Street Warehouse, Warehouse Project & Printworks have propelled him in the UK as one of the hottest tickets in house music. Never more evident than at his standout Creamfields set this summer at the all-new Runway stage. Outside of the UK, SOSA has been enjoying a successful 2022 season in Ibiza and has also become a fan's favorite across the Netherlands and Italy. SOSA toured the USA for the first time in 2022, with his 9-date Dance Lapse tour taking center stage. The young Liverpudlian also returned with another COCO show in his hometown, selling out Invisible Wind Factory and joined by wAFF and Lyndsey Matthews.",

      "name": "Sullivan King",
      "bio": "Sullivan King is the under-the-radar rebel with a mighty cause: The Los Angeles-based multi-instrumentalist/producer and solidified guitar god is setting out to shatter the mold and to disrupt the electronic world-one lick at a time. Lifting the brash and rugged energy of bass music off the dance floors and the power of metal and hard rock from the stadiums, Sullivan King creates a musical mosh pit built entirely on rapid-paced, neck-snapping dubstep, intensely shredding guitars and a bold live show that pushes the boundaries of modern music performance. Launched in early 2014, the Sullivan King project is the artistic creation of Keaton Prescott, whose musical DNA is composed of one-half metal and one-half bass music. He initially discovered his love for music in his early teens after his mother encouraged him to pick up a hobby outside of his everyday humdrum. Like the sword of King Arthur, the guitar beckoned; with a fist in the air, he answered the call and never looked back. After discovering the music of Van Halen, via his father, Sully took a headfirst dive deep down the rabbit hole of guitar-based music. He soon discovered the progressive rock sounds of post-hardcore and emo/screamo from the aughts via his brother-at first coming across bands like From First to Last, Chiodos and Atreyu-and then explored the metalcore noise of acts like Escape the Fate, Bullet for My Valentine and Avenged Sevenfold. Altogether, these artists opened the floodgates and laid the foundation for his developing obsession with heavy metal, care of genre icons Pantera, Metallica and the like. Fast-forward a couple of years later when Sullivan King discovered the sounds of EDM after countless hours spent on hardcore gaming, where artists like Skrillex, Avicii, Rusko and Wolfgang Gartner ruled the sound waves across global online gaming communities. It was in 2012 at the now-defunct Sunset Strip Music Festival, however, when he witnessed the analog spirit of punk rock come to life via the digital workings of a DJ and his decks as the notorious Steve Aoki manned the stage. Suddenly, it all clicked. Keaton's newfound love for EDM begot a cultural crossroads where bass music and metal live in a harmonious yet hellish balance. After exploring and perfecting his trademark sound at the revered Icon Collective Music Production School in Los Angeles, he set off to launch his solo artist career. And thus, Sullivan King was born. Today, Sullivan King boasts an inimitable style and sound with no regard to genre confines. His original tracks, remixes and reimagined renditions take the vitality of dance music and run it through the metal machine. The result is a bold, forward-pushing sound that's equal parts electric and heavy. For a taste of the fury, he offers a full-on metal assault in his remake of dubstep classic \"Bass Cannon\" from Flux Pavilion, in which Sullivan King unleashes a relentless salvo of diabolic guitars, screeching solos, double-pedal drums and shrieking vocals. On \"Lockdown,\" a collaboration with The Chainsmokers' drummer Matt McGuire and rapper Sam King, he goes for the jugular as he detonates a bass bomb over dubstep-fueled drops and blazing guitar licks. Elsewhere, his reworks have brought the immense metal touch to numerous EDM anthems, including \"Tremor\" (Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike and Martin Garrix) and \"Kick Out the Epic Motherf\\*\\*ker\" (Dada Life), both remixes with frequent collaborator Riot Ten. Already, Sullivan King has locked in massive collaborations with a number of high-profile producers, including \"Pure Evil\" with Jauz (March 2014), which counts over 1 million plays on SoundCloud to date, and \"Kill It With Fire\" with Ghastly (August 2014), both released on Borgore's Buygore imprint. He's also released a string of powerful original tracks and remixes on several influential independent EDM imprints, including: \"Till We Die\" with KAYZO on Headhunterz's HARD with STYLE (November 2015); \"Fuck It\" with Riot Ten on Excision's Rottun Recordings (December 2016); \"We in Here\" with Nightowls featuring Dan Rudd on Kannibalen Records (February 2017); and his remix collaboration with RYLE of Excision's \"Codename X\" on Rottun Recordings (January 2016). By the end of his debut year, Sullivan King accumulated over 2.4 million plays worldwide, an impressive figure for a new artist by any measure. Additionally, his music production work has been featured in a number of feature film projects, including: the official trailer for the international blockbuster X-Men: Apocalypse; a Spider-Man: Homecoming TV spot; and the trailer for American Made, starring Tom Cruise. On the live front, Sullivan King truly comes to life as he clashes analog traditions with digital attitude via a proper one-man show. His live setup-composed of Pioneer CDJ decks, a microphone, a laptop running Ableton, his faithful Schecter guitar and a Guitar Wing from Livid Instruments, which he uses to manipulate and trigger pre?-recorded loops and sounds-allows him to adapt the best of both worlds into his shows and create unique performances every single time via impromptu guitar solos and varying track selections on the DJ end. His live shows have already gained the attention of the live music and concert industries: He's performed at historic venues, including Avalon Hollywood in Los Angeles and Webster Hall in New York City, and he's also secured official sponsorships with Livid Instruments and Schecter Guitars, where he became the first EDM artist signed to the guitar brand's roster. Sullivan King is today at the helm of a burgeoning musical movement. As one of the few artists to successfully marry heavy metal and electronic music, he's birthed a new creative space all its own. \"If DJs are today's rock stars, then Sullivan King is forging his own rock galaxy,\" agrees LA Weekly (2/19/16). \"I'm taking an idea and creating something I've always wanted to hear in electronic music that wasn't always there: the live element,\" says Sullivan King. \"I wanted to hear people putting guitars and drums and screams and vocals behind electronic music.\" For him, this sound is no gimmick; it's his mission. \"I started this project to make music I wanted to listen to and to fill the gap missing in live electronic music. I'm leading the sound and pushing it forward, because I believe there's something to develop here.\" This year is set to be Sullivan King's biggest and most prolific yet. His release schedule is as busy as ever, with forthcoming projects that include: an official remix of Excision's \"With You\" on Rottun Recordings; a collab EP with Riot Ten (Rottun Recordings); the single \"Break The Rail\" with Dubloadz on prominent bass label Disciple Recordings; his debut solo EP on Kannibalen Records; and collaborations with mega artists Kill the Noise, Snails, and Slander. This fall, Sullivan King is also scheduled to perform at the debut of Excision's Lost Lands festival and is joining electro trio Black Tiger Sex Machine on their West Coast/Midwest Midnight Terror Tour. At a time when the musical realms of electronic and pop churn out cookie-cutter music on the daily, Sullivan King is paving his own path as he pioneers this metal-EDM hybrid sound. He breaks free from the norm and instead opts to remain loyal to his vision like a true artist, regardless of genre and industry trends. And to the haters and non-believers, he raises a fist and a middle finger in the air: Sullivan King has arrived to take the throne.",

      "name": "TOKiMONSTA",
      "bio": "GRAMMY-nominated producer TOKiMONSTA (Jennifer Lee) has charted a fascinating career over the past decade. She is one of the most revered music producers as one of the pioneers of the seminal 2010 era “L.A. Beat Scene.” As a world-class performer, she ranks as one of the Top 100 DJs worldwide (DJ Mag) and has performed at nearly every major festival worldwide. From her 2010 debut album Midnight Menu to her most recent 2020 album Oasis Nocturno, her entire discography has drawn critical praise from NPR, BBC, LA Times, NY Times, DJ Mag, Rolling Stone, Billboard, Pitchfork and more. As it stands, her list of collaborators includes Anderson .Paak, EARTHGANG, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Yuna, ZHU, Bibi Bourelly, The Drums — and up-and-coming artists she seeks out to mentor. With over 400 million streams and counting, she remains in demand having remixed the likes of David Bowie, Sia, Beck, Duran Duran, Portugal the Man, Disclosure, ODESZA and Ólafur Arnalds.\n\nFollowing her second album Half Shadows, TOKiMONSTA established and began releasing on her own label Young Art Records. Minialbums, Desiderium and FOVERE both featured artist Anderson .Paak and some of her most belovedsongs to date. After anchoring her label with her GRAMMY nomination, Young Art has continued to soar with notable releases being Rochelle Jordan’s Juno Award-nominated album Play with the Changes featuring production by KAYTRANADA, Jimmy Edgar and Machinedrum, and critically acclaimed album Svengali by Cakes da Killa (rated 4/5 stars by The Guardian).\n\nAt the end of 2015, her career temporarily came to a halt after being diagnosed with a rare and fatal cerebral vascular disease known as Moyamoya. After undergoing two consecutive brain surgeries, TOKiMONSTA was left with acute aphasia, meaning she could no longer verbally communicate. She soon discovered she had also lost the ability to comprehend the thing most important to her, music. Through perseverance and healing, her cognitive and creative faculties returned. Her Moyamoya journey gained more wide-spread attention after starring in the first season finale of the Netflix series Vox, Explained.\n\nAfter her recuperation, she made a triumphant comeback with a jaw-dropping performance at Coachella and a new body of work, her critically acclaimed album, Lune Rouge. Her third full-length album was nominated for ‘Electronic Album of the Year’ by the Recording Academy at the 2019 GRAMMY Awards. More than just an accolade, her nomination was an astounding achievement as she was the first Asian American producer and first female producer ever nominated in the category.\n\n2020 brought a deeper evolution as TOKiMONSTA shared her fourth full-length album, Oasis Nocturno. It highlighted her effortless flow between the stylings of house, soul and hip-hop. Following her album, her single “The Flower Blooms\" was a focus track on Netflix’s Squid Game (Let’s Play) EP. Right after the release of her official remix for David Bowie’s 1975 hit “Golden Years,” she went on to win Best Remix from DJ Mag for her remix of Sia and Neneh Cherry’s “Manchild.” Most recently, she released \"Eats The Tale\" on Young Art Records, a genre-bending track with label-mate Rochelle Jordan. The single was showcased in Times Square NYC by Spotify for New Music Friday. The rest of 2023 has her continuing her Booms & Blooms tour globally and preparing for more new music in 2024.\n\nTOKi has now entered the world of tech, having co-founded a music tech startup by the name of Sona. The aim of Sona is to democratize music streaming for artists in a world where the pay per stream is not adequate for a musician’s cost of living. The protocol and platform will reconstruct the scaffolding of music streaming so that audiences still have access to all the music they desire, while allowing artist’s payout to equate to what they truly deserve. After a successful seed round in 2022, the company is aiming to launch late 2023.",

Propelled by their infinite ambition and childhood dream, the innovative duo mange to shatter the glass ceiling of the psychedelic scene, leading the tribe into a new era.\n\nVoted #72 by “Dj Mag Top 100 Dj’s” (2017) , The No. 1’s / Walla Nightlife Awards ‘Dj Of The Year’ (2017), Beatstats “Best Selling Psytrance Artist” (2015, 2016, 2017), and #12 on “Trance Podium Top 100 Dj’s” (2017), these are merely a part of the accomplishments already under their belt. A long list of collaborations with some of the world's leading DJs pays testament to the powerful impact the Vini Vici sound has had on the global electronic music market. Armin Van Buuren, Dimitry Vegas & Like Mike, Steve Aoki, W&W, KSHMR, Astrix, Timmy Trumpet... to name but a few.\n\nA glimpse into Vini Vici Tour dates reveals a glittering list of some of the world most desirable events; Tomorrowland, EDC (Las Vegas, Orlando, Mexico, India, Japan), Ultra (Miami, Brazil Europe), Dreamstate, ASOT, AMF, Dreambeach, Creamfiled, Electric Love, Airbeat One, World Club Dome, Transmission, Electronic Family, 808, DLDK, Sunburn, Boom, Psy-Fi, XXXperience, Tribe, Mandallah, Alien Trip, Sonora, Insonia, Unity, Psychedelic Experience, Indian Spirit, Burning Mountain, Vuuv........

      "bio": "For Sam Walker and Gavin Royce, the question is the fundamental test of their studio output. Simple as it may sound, for this perfectionist pair it’s anything but. Their innate dance floor intuition, combined with years of experience behind the decks, drives them to create music that isn’t just playable — it’s irresistible.\n\nFirst introduced by way of New York City's early-aughts dance music scene, Sam Walker and Gavin Royce first teamed up for a remix in 2011. The duo found early success on tastemaker labels like Crosstown Rebels, OFF Recordings, and Moda Black, scoring an Essential New Tune nod from Pete Tong with 2014’s “Sister.” The indie dance and deep house sounds that informed Walker & Royce’s earliest work soon gave way to something different. Quirky accents and bouncy synths, previously deeper in the mix, leapt to the forefront, backed by a propulsive new energy. The success of their November 2015 “Bright Lights” remix was a clear indication that they were onto something.\n\nIn October 2017, Walker & Royce released their debut album Self Help on Dirtybird, which both showcased and expanded upon their now-signature sound. The guys enlisted numerous vocalists, including Green Velvet, Dances With White Girls, and Sophiegrophy, to make Self Help feel like a packed house party – while leaving no doubt about who was hosting. Self Help was followed by further experimentation and growth. Sam and Gavin have collaborated with Ardalan, Chris Lake and VNSSA; remixed The Knocks and Justin Jay; and put out music on Relief, Black Book, HotBOi Records and more. Now, their new Rave Grave EP is the inaugural release on Diplo’s house-focused imprint Higher Ground.\n\nWalker & Royce have spent years honing in on their one-of-a-kind style, meticulously crafting the sounds they want their fans to hear in clubs, at festivals and in their headphones. The result is a cohesive, career-defining body of work that firmly places the duo at the forefront of dance music's future.",

Each release has made the charts. He has released many DJ MIX compilations in Japan and abroad, handpicking a list of popular DJs.\n\nIn 2001, he released his first artist album “TECHNICOLOR NRG SHOW” from avex (released overseas by ID&T in the Netherlands) and the first Japanese DJ live DVD “TECHNICOLOR NRG SHOWCASE” in Japan. With a powerful stage presence and a string of original works that have become global anthems, he has jet-set across the globe to Western and Eastern Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, North America, Southeast Asia, and Oceania, where he broke out with an unprecedented run of performances including Mysteryland, Defqon-1 Mysteryland, Defqon-1, Dance Valley, Tomorrowland, In Control, EDC, Creamfields, too numerous to enumerate..(see “Primary Festivals and events that YOJI appeared in the past” as bellow).\n\nHe was the headliner at Sensation Black in Amterdam for a groundbreaking two years in a row, and has frequently ranked in the DJ Mag Top 100, climbing to the unparalleled 32nd position for a Japanese artist. In 2003, he won the Grand Prix at the Hard Dance Awards, established in the U.K. in its first year, and in 2011, he won two awards, Outstanding Contributions and Best International DJ in Asia, in recognition of his contribution to the scene. His achievement in bringing hard electronic dance music from the underground to the mainstream market is a milestone in music history, and is one of the reasons why he is called an industry legend.\n\nHe has been performing under the artist name “YOJI” (without “BIOMEHANIKA”) since 2007, and has been advocating a hybrid music style “Tech Dance” that shifts more toward techno. He had many hits such as “SIX HOURS“, “TECHY TECHY“, “AIRPORT“, and others. After about 7 years of musical exploration under this style, he returned to his identity as a melodic big room sound.\n\n‘15 He has rebooted as YOJI BIOMEHANIKA with a full heart. Released his 3rd album “CHAPTER X” from avex EDM, his first album in 11 years, and all the single cuts from the album ranked high on iTunes. In 2016, he launched the “BANGINGLOBE” label (under dieTunes) as a platform for overseas. Releases from avex in Japan are developed overseas from there, and each release is on the world dance charts. All three parts of the digital album “A QUARTER CENTURY OF YOJI BIOMEHANIKA“, a compilation of Yoji’s musical history released at the end of 2017, ranked in Beatport’s Top 5 albums.\n\n‘18 Rework of one of his signature track, “HARDSTYLE DISCO (2018 REVERSE BASS EDIT)” was released and received a GOLD on DJ Mag review. The track is a huge anthem that continues to be loved by many artists around the world, and NWYR (W&W) performed a cover of the track at Tomorrowland in 2017, where it became a scene sensation. The remix by Da Tweekaz and Sub Zero Project was released on avexEDM in Japan and DirtyWorkz in Belgium, and became a mega hit.\n\nIn the same year, he supervised the production of Japan’s first major hardstyle compilation “BANGINGLOBE PRESENTS SUPER HARDSTYLE” (avexEDM), which reached number one on the iTunes dance chart on its first day of release.\n\nPost-Corona Under the pandemic, YOJI has begun to face himself deeply and develop his activities to pursue his own personality. He has updated many of the songs he has written over the course of his 30 years of activity, and is now ready to demonstrate the true value of YOJI BIOMEHANIKA as an artist.",
